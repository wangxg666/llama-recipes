Swipe left, swipe right, check messages (nothing). Yawn. It feels like when job applications went digital. Don't call us, we'll call you, (but no one calls). So where does one go to meet singles around here, like in-the-flesh meet singles around here? I'm in the 35-45yo singles crowd specifically (divorced), so probably the hippest Gen-Z hangout is not my style, but for the good of all single folk, let's broadcast those places out there!If you find out, please let me know. I recently learned about this speed dating company. I haven‚Äôt tried it so I can‚Äôt vouch. But I‚Äôm intrigued by this idea. Also sooo done with the apps. https://shuffle.dating/#64b5eed979ca3e1e940d59c0 I don‚Äôt think using apps became a thing due to COVID. Using apps has been pretty common for many years prior to COVID. Tinder started in 2012. eharmony began over 23 years ago. 35-45? At work. Or hobby meetups. Got divorced in 2021 and last time I dated was 2009 so I am equally lost with dating apps. I‚Äôve been on some dates through them, mostly through the HER app, but nothing‚Äôs really panned out at all and the whole experience is exhausting. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I moved here at 39, but coffeeshops have been where I have met friends and serious boyfriends. eta for the past 30 years, I mean. in college, after college and post-divorce ",
        "article_b": "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the dating scene in California has seen a significant shift. Many singles turned to dating apps during the lockdown, but the digital platform now seems to be losing its charm. The swiping left and right, checking messages only to find nothing new, has become a monotonous routine for many. The situation is reminiscent of the digital job application process where the applicant is left waiting for a call that never comes. The question that arises now is, where can one meet singles in person in California? This question is particularly relevant for the 35-45-year-old singles crowd, who may not find the trendiest Gen-Z hangouts suitable for their taste. \n\n**User Comments Analysis**\n\nThe social media discussion on this topic provides some interesting insights. One user mentioned a speed dating company, Shuffle Dating, as a potential alternative to the dating apps. However, they haven't tried it themselves yet and are merely intrigued by the concept. \n\nAnother user pointed out that the use of dating apps predates the COVID-19 pandemic. They reminded that popular platforms like Tinder and eHarmony have been around for years, with Tinder launching in 2012 and eHarmony over 23 years ago.\n\nSeveral users suggested more traditional ways of meeting singles. One user suggested meeting people at work or through hobby meetups, while another user shared their personal experience of meeting friends and serious partners at coffee shops. This user has been successful in making connections in such settings for the past 30 years, including during their college years, after college, and post-divorce.\n\n**What Do You Think?**\n\nThe shift in the dating scene post-COVID is a topic of great interest. What are your thoughts on this? Have you found dating apps to be a black hole, or have they worked for you? Do you have any suggestions for places to meet singles in person in California, particularly for the 35-45 age group? We invite you to share your experiences and views on this topic.",

Each block was 10-weeks in length, with a 3-week intersession between. In addition to standard academic and elective classes, classes in the construction trades - carpentry; welding; design - and small business entrepreneurship, were offered. Intersession class offered classes for making up credits due to classes that were failed, and supplemental activity classes focusing on outdoor activities. Due to constant conflicts coordinating with the activities and sports programs of other schools on traditional schedules, and with school district professional training programs, the year-around schedule was discontinued in the 1987‚Äì1988 school year. Mesa Verde changed to a traditional August to June two semester schedule from 1987 to 1996. Because of gradual declining enrollment in the San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD), and the small student population creating difficulties in offering wanted elective classes in the school master schedule, a switch was made to a 4x4 block schedule. This allowed students to take 8 classes each full school year, rather than 6 classes under the traditional schedule. It gave Senior students who passed all of their classes and were on track to graduate the opportunity to have two \"open periods\" their senior year. This allowed them the option to start work, or take classes at local Community Colleges, during their senior year. The school continues with a 4x4 block schedule, with both the academic classes and elective classes changing regularly, based on School Board approved classes, student needs, staff changes, and community input. == Current School Statistics and Programs == Around 899 students currently attend Mesa Verde High School.Mesa Verde has a....
