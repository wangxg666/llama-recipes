CHALLENGING HIGH TEMPERATURE RECORDS ALMOST EVERY DAY OF THE NEXT SEVEN. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS HEAT IS GOING TO HOLD PROBABLY THROUGH NEXT WEEK AS WELL. IT'LL BE 90S AND TRIPLE DIGITS TODAY, BUT ONLY TO ABOUT 100IN SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SOME OF OUR UPPER ELEVATION NORTHERN MOUNTAIN CITIES MAY NOT TOUCH 90 DEGREES, BUT WE'LL BE CLOSE IN TAOS AND SANTA FE. OUR RAIN CHANCE IS ABOUT ZEROED OUT FOR ALBUQUERQUE AND SANTA FE.

HERE'S SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO, 92, SILVER CITY, ABOUT 100 OFF THE MOUNTAINS. STILL A CHANCE TO SCATTERED, ISOLATED STORMS TODAY. BUT THEN WE'RE DRY AND WE'RE UP BY ABOUT FIVE DEGREES BY THE WEEKEND. THAT'LL PUT THOSE CITIES OFF THE MOUNTAINS UP IN THAT 105 RANGE HEAT GROWING IN SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO. WE'VE GOT HIGHS IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS. AND THEN A CHANCE AT LATE DAY STORMS. WE'RE DRY FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, I THINK. AND THOSE WILL BE HEAT ADVISORY 105 PLUS HOURS FOR YOU AT LEAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HERE'S NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO. GOT VEGAS AT 90 TODAY. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT STORMS, MAYBE EVEN A SEVERE WEATHER THREAT FOR THE FAR NORTHEAST. THEN WE DO DRY IT OUT INTO AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND KEEP THOSE HIGHS INTO THE 90S. SATURDAY, PROBABLY THE HOTTEST DAY. THEN THE LITTLE HEAT RELIEF EARLY NEXT WEEK, 94 IN ESPANOLA NEAR 90 IN SANTA FE, GOT TAOS AT 88 DEGREES, PROBABLY DRY HERE IN NORTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO.

ACTION 7 NEWS REPORTER JOHN CARDINAL IS HERE NOW. JOHN, REMIND US WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER LAST YEAR AND HOW IT RELATES TO THIS INDICTMENT. YEAH, SHELLEY, DOUG, BEFORE WE GO INTO THE DETAILS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IN NEW MEXICO, EACH POLITICAL PARTY GETS FIVE ELECTORS. THE PARTY THAT WINS SENDS THEIR ELECTORS TO THE CAPITOL IN SANTA FE TO CAST THEIR VOTES IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE PROCESS. THE PARTY THAT LOSES IS SUPPOSED TO DO NOTHING IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. NEW MEXICO'S DEMOCRATIC ELECTORS WERE CALLED UPON TO CAST BALLOTS. WHEN YOU GO AND VOTE FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, TECHNICALLY YOU'RE VOTING FOR A SLATE OF ELECTORS WHO ARE PLEDGED. THEIR LOYALTY TO THAT CANDIDATE. THOSE DEMOCRATIC ELECTORS MET AT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND FILLED OUT THIS CERTIFYING THAT WENT TO CONGRESS AND TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVE. IT'S O. JOE BIDEN WON BY A COMFORTABLE MARGIN. THE BIDEN ELECTORS MUST VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. THAT SAME DAY IN DECEMBER 2020, THE STATE'S REPUBLICAN PARTY SENT OUT THIS PRESS RELEASE. STATE. THEY REQUESTED THEIR FIVE ELECTORS VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. GIVEN THE PENDING LITIGATION CONCERNING THE ELECTION RESULTS. BUT WHEN THE ELECTORS GOT TO SANTA FE, THEY WERE TURNED AWAY BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THEY DID, HOWEVER, SIGN THIS CERTIFICATE OF VOTES FOR TRUMP AND PENCE AND SENT IT TO WASHINGTON. A TARGET 7. AN INVESTIGATION FOUND TWO OF THE FIVE REPUBLICAN ELECTORS WHO SIGNED THAT CERTIFICATE WERE CALLED UPON TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE JANUARY SIXTH COMMITTEE. SO LET'S FAST FORWARD TO YESTERDAY. NEW MEXICO WAS ONE OF THE SEVEN STATES. IT WAS WAY DOWN ON THEHE LIST AS FAR AS THE PRIORITY, BUT IT STILL MADE THE LIST AS FAR AS THE INDICTMENT. SO IT THROWS NEW MEXICO INTO THIS MIX IN A VERY INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT WAY. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S INDICTMENT MENTIONS NEW MEXICO EIGHT TIMES AND LISTS US AS ONE OF THE STATES TO HAVE COCONSPIRATORS WHO TRIED TO SEND FALSE CERTIFICATION TO THE VICE PRESIDENT IN CONGRESS. WE ASKED OUR LEGAL EXPERT, WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO THOSE COCONSPIRATORS? WELL, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE EXTENT OF THEIR LIABILITY, IF THERE'S ANY CRIMINAL LIABILITY. I THINK WHAT'S MORE LIKELY AND WE'VE SEEN THIS IN OTHER CASES, IS THAT THESE ELECTORS MAY HAVE CUT A DEAL WITH PROSECUTORS TO GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE SCHEME WENT DOWN. THE INDICTMENT ALSO CLAIMS AN ATTORNEY IN NEW MEXICO HELPED ASSIST IN THE ALLEGED FRAUDULENT ELECTOR EFFORT. IF YOU'RE A LICENSED ATTORNEY AND YOU ENGAGE IN ANY SORT OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY OR ACTIVITY THAT'S DEEMED CRIMINAL, NOT ONLY COULD YOU FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LAW LICENSES. AND ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT, THE ALLEGED NEW MEXICO COCONSPIRATOR STILL SENT A LETTER TO WASHINGTON, EVEN THOUGH FORMER PRESIDENENT TRUMP LOST BY MORE THAN 10% OF THE POPULAR VOTE IN OUR"

THAT INCLUDES A FRAUDULENT ELECTOR CONSPIRACY THAT PROSECUTORS SAY WOULD CREATE A FAKE CONTROVERSY AT THE CERTIFICATION PROCEEDING. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT KALYN NORWOOD IS IN WASHINGTON FOR US WITH HOW THAT SCHEME WOULD HAVE PLAYED OUT. FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD AND EFFORTS TO CONVINCE OFFICIALS IN SEVEN STATES TO SUBMIT FRAUDULENT SLATES OF ELECTORS TO CONGRESS. THOSE ARE THE CHARGES AT THE FOCUS OF TUESDAY'S INDICTMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SPECIAL COUNSEL. SO HOW WOULD THAT HAVE WORKED? LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE ROLE ELECTORS PLAY IN OUR ELECTION. ELECTORS ARE APPOINTED BY STATE PARTIES REPRESENTING VOTERS AT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND BASED ON WHO WON THE POPULAR VOTE. BUT IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING THE ELECTION, UNOFFICIAL ELECTORS IN SEVEN BATTLEGROUND STATES SIGNED CERTIFICATES FALSELY STATING THAT TRUMP, NOT DEMOCRAT JOE BIDEN, WON THEIR STATES. THAT HAPPENED IN ARIZONA, GEORGIA, MICHIGAN, NEW MEXICO, NEVADA, PENNSYLVANIA AND WISCONSIN. THE INDICTMENT ALLEGES AS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE CONVENED IN DECEMBER OF 2020 TO CERTIFY THE RESULTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, REPUBLICANS, WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUMP ELECTORS IN THOSE SEVEN STATES ALSO MET AND SUBMITTED UNOFFICIAL ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATES TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS, DECLARING DONALD TRUMP THE WINNER OF THEIR STATE. EVEN THOUGH THAT WASN'T THE CASE, PROSECUTORS SAY HE KNOWINGLY USED FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD TO SUBVERT THE LEGITIMATE ELECTION RESULTS. THE SCHEME FAILED ON JANUARY 6TH, WHEN CONGRESS CONVENED TO CERTIFY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS. THE VOTES COUNTED WERE THE OFFICIAL SLATES OF ELECTORS AND WASHINGTON. I'M KALYN NORWOOD. SEVERAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN ALLIES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE TRIED TO CHALLENGE SEVERAL OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. THOSE CHALLENGES FAILED AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INDICTMENT COULD PLAY A ROLE IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ACTION 7 REPORTER LISA MUNOZ IS HERE AFTER SPEAKING WITH OUR POLITICAL EXPERT ABOUT HOW THIS COULD IMPACT NEW MEXICO VOTERS. WELL, SHELLEY AND DOUG, FOR YEARS, NEW MEXICO HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A BLUE STATE. LOOKING BACK AT THE 2020 ELECTION HERE NEXT TO ME, YOU CAN SEE THAT ALTHOUGH NEW MEXICO STAYED BLUE, THERE WERE SOME VOTES FOR TRUMP. AND IN GENERAL, ELECTION NEWS LIKE THIS COULD HURT DONALD TRUMP. AMONG THOSE VOTERS WHO ARE ON THE FENCE. THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM FOR ATTEMPTING TO OVERTURN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COULD AFFECT HOW OR IF VOTERS ARE WILLING TO BACK HIM. BUT SANDRA DOES THINK THIS COULD AFFECT HIS CAMPAIGN. TREASURY. WE'VE SEEN HOW HIS CAMPAIGN TREASURY IS BEING DEPLETED BY A LOT OF THOSE CAMPAIGN FUNDS ARE GOING TO PAY FOR HIS LEGAL DEFENSE IN MANY OF THE OTHER INVESTIGATIONS AND CHARGES AGAINST HIM. SO IT COULD BE A DISTRACTION TO HIS CAMPAIGN. THOSE OTHER INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST TRUMP INCLUDE DOCUMENTS PROBE JANUARY 6TH, ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL AND ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN GEORGIA RESULTS. SANDRA SAYS STATES LIKE ARIZONA COULD BE IMPACTED MORE BY THIS CHARGE BECAUSE THEY'RE KNOWN AS A PURPLE STATE. BUT NEW MEXICO HAS BEEEEN TRENDG BLUE IN RECENT PRESIDENTIAL RACES. TYPICALLY, THE DEMOCRATS BEEN WINNING BY DOUBLE DIGITS. SO THEY'RE AGAIN, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, NEW MEXICO WILL CONTINUE TO BE BLUE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SANDRA WOLF ALSO SAYS TRUMP'S POLL NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED SINCE THESE CHARGES. REPORTING IN STUDIO, ALYSSA MUNOZ, KOAT ACTION SEVEN NEWS. A NEW YORK TIMES SANTA COLLEGE NATIONAL POLL SHOWS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP REMAINS FAR AND AWAY THE LEADER FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. HE IS RUNNING EVEN WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN IN THE 2024 REMATCH. THAT SURVEY ALSO SHOWS BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND TRUMP ARE VIEWED MORE NEGATIVELY THAN POSITIVELY BY VOTERS. NEW FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES RELEASED TODAY SHOW HOW MUCH THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS SPENDING ON LEGAL BATTLES. CAMPAIGN FINANCE RECORDS SHOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON LEGAL FEES, INCLUDING $25 MILLION SPENT BY A NETWORK OF POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES, ALLIES OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT ARE LAUNCHING A NEW LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO RAISE EVEN MORE MONEY. IF I WEREN'T RUNNING, I WOULD HAVE NOBODY COMING AFTER ME OR IF I WAS LOSING BY A LOT, I WOULD HAVE NOBODY COMING AFTER ME. OUTSIDE OF FUNDRAISING FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT, A SUPER PAC SUPPORTING FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS HAS RAISED THE MOST MONEY SO FAR IN THE GOP FIELD TO SAY UP TO DATE WITH THE TRUMP INDICTME"

(7-31-23)",so the Pentagon has reaffirmed its commitment to protecting reproductive health care for service members our Lauren Tom spoke with the Bay Area veteran who knows firsthand what's at stake when Dr Aileen fry Bowers entered the Navy she was told she would sacrifice much more than her time in service to the military on the other hand you're also told that in return the military is going to take care of you that the United States is going to provide for your safety your security and that they're going to provide good routine health care for you because that's how you're going to be able to continue to finish fulfill your mission as a service member but today that care hangs in the balance of a Capitol Hill dispute over the military's commitment to providing reproductive health care for female service members and as the dean of the USF nursing school and Mom of two Freight Bowers knows firsthand the significance of women's health care for active duty service members the consequence is then that one or in dual couples you know one or both may choose to leave the military which is really unfortunate Mission Readiness is at stake Pentagon leaders say is Republican senator Tommy tuberville holds out on confirming key military nominations until the defense department reverses its abortion policy that provides leave-in reimbursement costs for service members who must travel for the procedure more than 100 military bases reside in states where abortion access has become restricted in the wake of Roe v Wade overturned by the Supreme Court prompting concern among service members about their own access to the procedure that's a little frustrating when you know policies continue to be directed without thought about the impact on our female service members but the Pentagon is standing firmly by its policy earlier this month National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby maintained that such care is an obligation to all service members and it matters because it says we're invested in you because you are being willing to invest in US you're investing your life your family's livelihood with us we owe you bet that back in return according to the defense department 91 abortions were performed in military medical facilities over a five-year span from 2016 to 2021 and only for cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is at risk and freibauer says the policy comes down to morale it's putting the the power back in the hands of the individual service member to determine what works best for them in their normal human desire to form a family and I think that's that's really important just for the morale of our military we want service members that feel like whole people the long-term consequences could be severe she says but for now she's proud to stand behind the Pentagon leaders who are set on preserving access to reproductive health if Denver bill doesn't release his whole 650 officers could be held back from promotion by the end of the year

Alameda Contra costs are about five cents behind that and the lowest in the Bay Area you're gonna find that over in Santa Clara Clara County at 486 in Solano County at 484. overall we're still over a dollar or so than that national average but hopefully we do start to see things coming down but right now that trend is starting to trickle up rather than trickle down coming up we're going to talk to some drivers and see if they've noticed anything while they've been fueling up on their morning commutes live in Walnut Creek I'm Michael Thomas story James I'll send it back to you thank you Michael
0neLOwr7,Bay Area Newscast,This guy is so full of sh!t,Chris Cuomo Addresses Misconceptions Surrounding Rising San Francisco Crime Rates,https://newsbreak.com/n/0neLOwr7,Chris Cuomo weighs in on San Francisco crime,"A special edition of ""Cuomo"" will air Monday on News Nation. News anchor Chris Cuomo will speak about potential solutions to crime with mayors, law enforcement and others. https://www.kron4.com",news nation is going to be hosting a town hall called crime in America and part of that discussion is going to include San Francisco it's coming this Monday it's going to be hosted by Emmy award-winning journalist and host of news Nations Cuomo Chris Cuomo who in fact joins us live this morning from New York to talk a bit about this Chris thank you so much I know you've been doing a ton of these interviews today so we appreciate you carving out some time to join us this morning hey more better more better James Daria thank you very much for the opportunity obviously San Francisco has been in the crosshairs of national scrutiny uh in a problem that I believe is being exaggerated but more importantly misunderstood and that really is what crime is about people twist reality uh to their own agenda so what we're trying to do at news nation is get back to straight talk about what matters most to the most people and what that means uh with San Francisco and we do have Matt Dorsey district 6 supervisor who's going to be part of the conversation and Bravo to him and by extension San Francisco because I can't tell you how many people across the country who are in positions of responsibility want to duck the conversation and I'm going to call them out by name because the job is not to hide but we got to be afraid of twisting data and we have to be afraid of Simple Solutions to complex problems and crimes at the top of the list when you get to complex problems so you have to look at well what is the spike that we're talking about for instance um you know homicides are obviously the scariest okay you guys are up over 20 and homicides year over year who's doing the killing what is motivating it is it homeless is it addicted homeless is it about fentanyl coming in uh and irrational behavior is it about gangs is it about influx of weapons each one of those problems dictates a different structure of solutions you see what I'm saying yeah so you need to have the conversation but I'm also really curious about what you just said about the over like exaggeration because I travel a lot and the first thing people say when I say I'm from San Francisco is oh my God it's dangerous like it's a war zone and and we're talking about people from other areas of the country or even the world and I don't know what it what do you think is going on hype and you know you guys allowed a situation to be exploited you guys yes you James no you know it's about the political interplay San Francisco uh the backyard of Pelosi uh is seen as the Bastion of the left right and so they're gonna beat you over the head on the right uh with the perception of lawlessness and drug addicts and homelessness London run amok people love to judge addicts and homeless as being to blame for their own condition as if they're lazy and bad and if you don't fight that perception you know we always say I tell people all the time in the media if you don't tell me your story someone else is going to tell it and I guarantee you you won't like the ending but that said well it's for you Governor uh and to make the case and it's for the local officials the San Francisco mayor doesn't want to come on Dorsey does so he will and what is causing the homelessness homelessness what are you doing about it right um what is causing the addiction what are you doing about it what works there what isn't working what have we seen in other places and I'm really hoping for That Sweet Spot of the interplay between regular folks who are just pissed about what's going on officials who are fighting it on the police side politicians who are trying to deal with it or not and get a little bit of that conversation going if there's disagreement great you want to blame me as being in the media and hyping it fine fair questions but it's about disagreement with decency to try to get us to a better place well and what I like about the uh what you're aiming to do is hopefully by the end of this thing maybe find a solution maybe find an example of somebody somewhere in the country doing something that's finding success that maybe other communities can model I hope that comes out of it too well look it should because that is happening already look crime is up why depends what we're talking about and where we're talking about it and I know that's frustrating for people but you got to make a choice okay if you want it simple you'll get it simple but it will be deceptive and it will be the fuel and agenda if you want it to be fixed you got to get away from left and right and get back to reasonable and reasonable takes time it takes money and it takes trial and error and error in politics gets you killed yeah it does so It's Tricky but I know that this is the way forward Town Hall open space safe place to talk okay so in the few seconds we have left then let everybody know so this is Monday you're going to be in New York but you've got live audiences elsewhere too lay it out for us got live audiences in Chicago Texas uh Fort Worth and uh here in New York and we'll have officials from all across the country uh as well and look it's just a starting point news Nation just wants to get back to doing what matters to the most people and a town hall on crime is a great way to do that and we'll do more on it we'll do others like it to the extent that the audience wants it well thank you so much Chris I'm really looking forward to it and it's an honor I think your heart is always in the right place and you can tell that you just want to make the world a better place and I love it and keep their feet to the fire you're great at that thank you Chris you're very kind and I appreciate the generous assessment okay all right see ya

self-discovery by a gay secret service agent the author is Corey Allen and Corey is joining us live this morning hi Corey good morning thank you for having me on uh from South Georgia oh very good okay well Corey before I start my questions I have a question that comes from my co-anchor Kumasi Aaron who will now be taking my seat okay so you're in south Georgia which is close to Jacksonville Florida which is where I saw Michelle Obama for the very first time she was visiting I think it was NAS Jax and I was so excited and I was trying to get to her to take a picture with her and I got up really close and then somebody was like uh-uh no can't touch her was it you it was not um I don't know what year this was but I assure you 2012 April 2012. no I was in Miami at the time I was not on their detail yet so it was not me okay you can continue Corey you may continue with this interview thank you very much [Laughter] okay so Corey before we get into all of the background of you coming out and the difficulties that that ensued because of that tell us who over the years you have protected as a member of their detail uh as far as permanent detail I was assigned to the Obamas from 2016 until 2019 when I came to California um and before that depending on the campaign 2012 you know bouncing between Mitt Romney and Obama Paul Ryan 2016 campaign Bernie Sanders Trump Hillary um visiting foreign heads of state the pope when he came to DC Trump's Inauguration in 20 16. so just kind of bounced all over the map but my my actual permanent detail was with you Obama's uh and two years of that was with Michelle so what was your favorite moment of protecting any one of these people and what was the worst um favorite moment um memorable was when the pope was in DC uh and having to be on that in just the momentous occasion that it that it is and that it was the amount of responsibility uh and we succeeded in keeping him safe um as well as traveling the world with Michelle Obama on the becoming book tour we traveled to all over the globe interactions with A-list celebrities Anderson Cooper Beyonce Jay-Z Bruce Springsteen the list goes on and on um but favorite moment was going to the Grammys with um Michelle Obama in 2019 that was my last actual trip with the Secret Service before I came to California for a new job um that was music ties its way through my story and so that was just a phenomenal experience to be on stage and be backstage with all these massive music icons who have idolized for so long yeah you talk about at one point being on this stage with Beyonce and Jay-Z just literally steps away from you you had all this access to these famous people and of course these really luminous political you know gods and goddesses but at the same time it also seemed like that wasn't really quite enough for you I mean you had made it really to the top Echelon of of you know the Secret Service and and of protecting people but it was all kind of like looking through a window at everything do I have that kind of right you you have it very right um it took a while for me to separate my personal identity from my professional identity I allowed them to become intertwined I became married to my job and and that became my identity I went through a divorce I was traveling so much um and at some point I stopped to reflect it was like this is not actually my life that I'm living is you just said I'm living it looking through the window of everybody else's lives and having all this access but at the same time it was never me that was in the spotlight it was never about me uh and I had to to take a stand to prioritize my own life and put my uh my own desires which is to have a family and settle down again so you had that 100 right what I've talked to friends of mine or even people who aren't you know necessarily in my personal life who are members of some kind of force whether it's a police force or the military it's always really interesting to me when they are you know gay men because it always feels like there is this extra layer of armor there's a physical armor that they wear but then there's also this layer of identity armor that they wear because they're they feel like they have something even more to prove did you feel that way I did and I still do I still struggle with that um and I I had to live two lives um to protect myself just to protect my career discrimination issues that have percolated through 22 years of government service you know at times I just could have been fired for being gay multiple times throughout my career um so I just had to live two different identities uh and here I'm actually at a Leadership Institute um this week and I talked about my book to in front of a class full of uh supervisory special agents and there's 350 years worth of experience in this room and I was terrified to talk about this publicly but also realizing to lower the fear I need to put my vulnerability out there uh and the response was fantastic and that was just this week that that occurred so I'm still finding that balance and figuring out that tool but then to have people reach out to me uh especially gay Law Enforcement Officers to thank me for telling my story to come out to me but also hear that this is still an issue for so many um so I do see an Avenue where this can help people and I I think that's a pivot I'm going to need to make because there's no like national uh Foundation that helps gay Law Enforcement Officers for resources for advocacy Etc well that's a really good idea you could start it it does seem like something that is that is necessary if we want to continue to you know Foster a belief that people can go into these lines of work oh absolutely and it's these experiences are just affirming that that's something that I want to do and I can do that in retirement and start building that now because it just does not exist and we need that to exist um so yeah I know it and that's something I can dive right into and be super passionate about so I do look forward to seeing how this develops well it's really I mean obviously you've let a very interesting life and it also just reminded me of you know the fact that when you live outside of a big city like San Francisco or Los Angeles or New York I mean there are still a lot of struggles when it comes to Growing Up and being gay especially when you're going into law enforcement in the military the book is called Breaking Free a saga of self-discovery by a gay secret service agent Corey Allen thanks so much for talking to us today thank you for having me Reggie uh great to see you again and uh enjoy the weekend that's coming up on us and we'll be right back

Speaking about *** story. Wdsu investigates recently uncovered *** student at Patrick F. Taylor says he has lived in fear for two years now. After *** while in *** virtual class, someone put up *** picture with his name, the *** word and *** brown stick figure hanging from *** noose wdsu investigative reporter Aubrey Killian is live in the newsroom with the latest Aubrey. Hey there. So the school board went into executive session for about one hour to discuss two lawsuits. One of those suits was related to my investigation. After that meeting, we pressed school leaders for answers when we asked to speak to doctor James Gray superintendent for JP schools. After Wednesday's public school board meeting, he left through *** back door. *** spokesperson said he wasn't taking questions because of pending litigation. I want something that has been so dark and dim and cruel to be brought to the light and I feel that that has not happened until now. Stephanie Miller says this image was shown in her son's virtual class back in 2021 at Patrick F Taylor in Avondale, the N word and *** brown stick figure hanging with *** noose around its neck was shown that's why the students were playing *** game. When we first broke this story. JP Schools says due to limited data retained by the app, the district was unable to identify the responsible party immediately after the incident. JP. Schools disabled the learning app district wide to prevent any further incidents. But after pressing the APP kit for answers, they released *** statement saying in part, Gim Kid has an optional security enhancement called classes that collects student names. The teacher did not opt to use this feature. Gim Kidd's software did not collect any identifying data on participating students. There's no perfect system. School board Vice President Derek Shepherd agreed to speak with us on camera. What can you tell us about the executive session that y'all went into? Uh We, we can't talk about that at all, but what I can say about this and this is to every child. You are welcome here in Jefferson Parish. Is there anything else you think could have been done after this? No, I haven't seen anything that we could have done. There is nothing on the planet to prevent someone with hatred, bigotry and prejudice in their heart from expressing that all we can do is ask the parents to be productive parents. But Miller's attorney disagrees and says it is the responsibility of the board to find out who exactly is responsible. Court records show the school is denying negligence JP. Schools tonight did say that they will provide the Director of School Safety tomorrow. That's for an interview back to you."

0nknWdB0,Buffalo TV Beat,State and local governments reimburse businesses for loss of business during construction. This business closed due to high rate of crime in Allentown. Tell the truth.,Allen Street Reconstruction Project Under Fire Amid Negative Impact on Allentown Businesses,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nknWdB0,Allentown community voices frustration over construction and impact on long-standing businesses,"The ongoing construction in the Allentown neighborhood has become a headache for business owners and residents alike, and now another Allen Street institution is closing its doors.",well good evening once again we begin tonight with a popular Buffalo neighborhood four years now into a multi-million dollar construction project but rather than signs of change many visitors to Allentown will notice signs that read for sale or even close so tonight we're exploring whether the Improvement efforts are actually having an opposite effect now the Allen Street reconstruction project began in 2019 with a five million dollar price tag it would widen the street between Maine and Wadsworth and install new sidewalks while this in turn would improve safety and enhance the economy the city wanted the two-phase project done by winter of 2022 but the project is behind schedule with active construction making it difficult to navigate the area several businesses have shut down or put their properties up for sale now we know this is a celebrated community that houses several different perspectives so I spent the day in the neighborhood talking with two business owners one frustrated by the construction's impact and the other now closing down after 20 years plus a resident who's witnessed the highs and lows of Allentown but we begin with the former manager at town restaurant whose sudden closure shocked many of us it's just super sad to see it end it's the end of an era in Allentown as Town Restaurant a staple of the neighborhood since 1972 announced Tuesday that it's closing its doors for good it was abrupt I was on my way to work and I got a phone call saying that we were going to be closed Nicole swed worked at Town restaurant for eight years and says she was shocked by the closing she believed several issues factored into the decision with the ongoing construction on Allen Street playing a big part we've been so slow the last couple years due to the construction and then it was over then it started again this side has been shut down for two years at this point the impact of construction also weighing heavy on the intersection Cafe only a couple doors down from town restaurant on Elmwood Avenue the lack of pedestrian traffic has impacted not just sales in our business but also the the the vibe of the street Heidi Jones is the owner of the intersection Cafe and has lived in Allentown for 15 years Jones says the construction has forced the hand of several nearby businesses and what's now become essentially a bar District we actually have threats of violence kind of regularly and there's no cop presence there's no government that cares so we're it's like the wild west out here and it's really problematic is this end of the street going to be able to come back I'm not really sure I think it's because people are fed up man David colon says he's lived in Allentown his whole life and says it's frustrating to see empty buildings and the turnover of several neighborhood businesses including Town Restaurant they paved the way for all their businesses and for them to lose their business or shut down it's it's it's sad we found another example just a short walk away where John Shepard the owner of antique man on Allen Street for 20 years was saying goodbye I'm finally doing my final uh pack up um we're closing the business Shepard tells me he was essentially forced to sell his building and close his doors due to the changing dynamics of the neighborhood and years of dwindling foot traffic this road construction took five years and we had the pandemic as well so the combination of those things just was awful for us and the business to be walking out and packing up for the for the final time what's what's that like for you what's that mean to you uh it's pretty traumatic honestly Shepard tells me he doesn't know what his future holds but wishes Allentown well after being a part of the neighborhood for two decades we didn't want to those but we couldn't stay open any longer yeah Shepherd clearly emotional today as he locked up really ending an era there on Allen Street now Buffalo's Department of Public Works is overseeing this reconstruction project so we asked the commissioner today for his message to the Allentown businesses trying to stay open while his crews are still working yeah I mean certainly um thank you for your cooperation and patience during this time I know it's a it's a tougher type of construction when we're when we've got to close traffic and do some of that underground infrastructure there's no other way to do it you just can't have traffic on going when you're digging holes six eight ten feet down so we understand that's a longer impact so appreciate the patience and the feedback to us you know some of the feedback that we get is is hey thanks for the work and some of it's a little more challenging to hear but you know we we certainly appreciate any any feedback we get we'll stand by our work and um and hopefully just get out of the way as soon as we can Oh Martin tells us this Final Phase is expected to wrap up by mid-october but their goal is to get it done

let's talk about this coveted cases are said to be on the rise across the country are you seeing that and are you seeing it locally so our national data is our best data and we are certainly seeing a rise in cases emergency room visits and hospitalizations the greatest increases that we've seen are in the South and the Northeast we're seeing similar but less pronounced increases in New York state but that's Statewide data we have more limited data in Erie County which suggests that we're having increases but not as pronounced as elsewhere as the country at least at this time okay so that's good news for us but how are these cases being reported now it's it's a lot different than during the pandemic people aren't necessarily reporting to their local Health departments anymore how do you know is it waste water that you're checking or how how do you know if cases are rising so tracking cases has been more challenging most people on testing or their home testing which is not reported PCR tests are way down so for numbers of cases waste water or Trends in Wastewater is one indication and Wastewater measurements that the viruses causes covet has been up over the last several weeks but also the increased emergency relations and hospitalizations also suggest we're having increasing cases or otherwise people wouldn't be showing up at those venues okay and then why do you think cases are on the rise well I think there's three main reasons first our Behavior we're Gathering and traveling pre-pandemic mode so there's lots of personal interactions secondly immunity from either vaccination or prior infection wanes over time and we're ways off from our most recent booster another one should be coming in the next 30 to 60 days and perhaps the most important driver is Heat lots of parts of this country have been extraordinarily hot it's driving people indoors and that's where the virus spreads best that's a good point I didn't I didn't think about that but now back on vaccinations you mentioned um what is happening with vaccinations how long do they last and it seems to me a lot of people maybe do for a vaccine and should we think about it like the flu vaccine that we get every fall are we just in that mode now I think we are I think we're looking at getting a coveted booster at least annually particularly for those individuals that are at greatest risk developing severe disease and hospitalizations our vaccines are imperfect against preventing infections so it's better than not getting vaccinated but we still see some infections but it's really been quite good in preventing hospitalizations and deaths which I think we could agree is the most important thing that we'd like to prevent looking back and I know this is a very big question but looking back we lost more than a million Americans during the pandemic this is your field what did we as a country do right or wrong well I think the thing that we did extraordinarily well is developing a vaccine so rapidly that saved countless lives in this country and around the globe so really that is one very positive thing the other very positive thing is we now have a very good treatment paxilvid being the best example if you are infected with covet and you're at high risk for developing severe disease if you start that early you'll significantly decrease the likelihood of Landing in hospital so those are two really bright spots that have occurred were masks effective oh there's no question that mass or effective if you use high quality masks and they fit properly and you actually wear them so those individuals and even now I suggest if you're you know our seniors with underlying diseases the most frail or immunocompromised where immunity may be less than optimal if you are on a highest risk setting wearing a mask is probably a good idea right now with this increasing number of cases okay Doctor very quickly finally I do want to ask you this do you think we are prepared for the next pandemic well I think we are certainly much better prepared uh for the next pandemic whenever that may occur and I think that has to do in large part that we've now got detection systems in place and vaccine development is going to be much more expedient than it was ever before all right Dr Thomas Russo don't stay away so long we'd like to have you back uh you know more often here it's great to see you I'm not sure when I'm here maybe that means things are going a little sideways but covered so maybe you want to see less always happy to see you thank you so much for coming in doctor

0ncswhZN,Cleveland Coverage,An alert for potential severe weather on Wednesday has been broadcasted by the reputable weather team in Cleveland...lolololololol you guys SUCK!!!,Cleveland Prepares for Severe Storms and Extreme Heat : Weather Alert Issued,https://newsbreak.com/n/0ncswhZN,19 First Alert Weather Days: Severe storms today; hottest day of the year Friday,"The 19 First Alert Weather Team has issued a 19 First Alert Weather Day for Wednesday. Scattered storms will move in during the afternoon, and some of those storms may be strong to severe. https://tinyurl.com/29ecv9n8",from Cleveland's most accurate weather team this is 19 First Alert plus sponsored by the man that makes them pay Tim misney and good morning I'm dander rose with 19 news now today is a First Alert weather day that's because we have the potential for some severe weather this afternoon when we take a live look into downtown Cleveland already 74 degrees and we know that that thermometer is going to be inching up hour by hour we're going to bring in 19 First Alert meteorologist Kelly doback Kelly today is one of those hot summer days that could lead to some of these potentially severe weather so really need to be on top of things today for our viewers right we've got all the ingredients there Dan for severe storms to fire up later today we've got a couple of things I want to break down here because it's one of those days where we are really keeping a close eye on this system as it moves in from the North and the West here because depending on its movement depending on the clouds that pop up ahead of it is all going to be dependent on how many storms we see that are strong to severe so let's start with that again we've got that sort of severe weather they're mainly around dinner time through the early overnight hours tonight and all modes of severe weather are possible we've I'll show you the risk map the severe tracker here in a moment but this system is very similar to the setup that we had last week it's just a little bit further north and that's what will make the difference in who sees a stronger storm so breaking down the timeline again this morning through the early afternoon hours we are watching that line like a hawk the whole weather team keeping an eye on it watching for clouds developing ahead of it showers developing ahead of it that could make things stable thunderstorms need instability they like that heat they like that humidity and we've got a lot of it and this storm has a lot of it to tap into but if we start seeing clouds fire up showers firing up ahead of time that'll help limit the storms from becoming severe now we've got all those ingredients in place they all have to mix together to create stronger storms so after five o'clock that's when that line will move in and then through midnight we'll be watching the severe threat end but we're also going to keep the chance for showers overnight into early Thursday morning so here's that severe tracker I was telling you about here so we've got the severe tracker it gives you a level one to five risk of severe weather with level five being you know this is a tornado outbreak really bad we've got a level three out of five including portions of Erie County out towards Sandusky and West towards Toledo level three out of five means severe weather is likely in that area and notice the orange kind of pushes a little bit further north on the map here that's where we have the highest severe ingredients a lot of fuel a lot of storm energy there notice though Cleveland and areas along the 71 Corridor we're in that level two out of five so severe weather is still possible here and again damaging wind gusts along this line hail brief tornado we can't rule out a brief spin up with the type of storm system that we are seeing develop out to the West right now and it's going to continue to weaken here as we head into uh East and then a little bit further later in the afternoon now before I show you future view I just kind of want to show you what we're looking at right now can I do like a now casting real analysis here of this storm that we're looking at so this is as soon as it pops up First Alert Doppler Network a wide view showing us the system that's coming in so that line of storms is slowly but surely starting to make its way here into portions of Illinois you can see uh the uh bowing out here just before it makes its way towards Chicago that's a good indication of yeah that's some very strong damaging wind gusts there's a severe thunderstorm warning there I also kept all this orange on the map to show you that is all heat advisory so look at how these storms are firing up along this line farther south here this is all that moisture the storm system is tapping into so that's why we've got the potential here but you notice these clouds that are developing ahead of the line here that's what we have to watch for uh storms to become you know more stable so a lot double-edged sword here we're watching all this heat and humidity fueled the storms but we're also watching for that potential for the clouds to kind of take over as we head into the afternoon and evening so here's future view keeping the temperatures on because it is going to be hot most likely we'll hit 90 degrees today if the clouds cooperate if we have more Sunshine but notice here we're seeing a couple of these little showers pop up at three o'clock this could make things stable again thunderstorms like sunshine they like heat humidity things that make them unstable and strong so as we continue through the afternoon notice a lot of the stronger portions of the storm are North I mentioned that this storm system is a little bit further a North trekking than the last one so that is a real possibility but as we head into you know eight nine o'clock you notice that line pushes right through Cuyahoga County all the way down the 77 Corridor so this potentially could produce damaging wind gusts heavy rain and I know a lot of people dealt with damage last week so if you have tree limbs that are loose if you are working on you know repairing flood damage secure everything down because even if it's not severe these are going to be strong storms coming through and it won't take much to see power outages it won't take much to see areas that did receive damage last week get more damage because things are loose and flooding it could also be a concern for areas that already did Flood so that's going to be you know the concern through 10 11 o'clock that's where the main severe threat is now here's the actual front coming in that'll produce Heavy Rain uh overnight into early Thursday morning so we'll still be watching that threat as well and that's just the alert day for today Dan with these clouds and showers around this is going to keep temperatures below 90 degrees Thursday but we've got nothing to prevent 90s and heat on Friday that's going to be our next alert day because it is going to be hottest day we've seen so far this year yeah and that'll be an alert day for us we're going to take 15 seconds and we'll talk more about Friday being an alert day as we head into the weekend give us 15 seconds I've represented families just like yours for over four decades listen if you need me call me you know I'll be there for you and I'll make them pay in the meantime I I'll keep an eye out for you and now it's time to keep an eye on the next three four days as the Heat and we've got alert days on Friday coming up yeah so today we're watching the storms again the whole team we've already been talking we've got all hands on deck today so we'll keep you covered if we do see any severe warnings fire up the 19 First Alert weather app is a great way to receive those warnings make sure you have two ways to get warnings because that threat does move in you know a little bit later at night when you are heading to bed so again tomorrow morning we'll have showers around that will keep temperatures still muggy still warm but not as hot as they were expected to be because of this system that's moving in later today talking about Friday here the 19 First Alert weather day we're talking about heat index what it feels like outside around 100 plus I mean I was looking at the heat index tracker and it was putting 105 heated next values what it feels like outside in Sandusky so anything outside Cedar Point if you work outside you know heat exhaustion is something that can come up so fast even if you don't have AC and you're dealing with the heat inside because it isn't going to be uh cooling off that much overnight these are all things to keep in mind and uh when you're like oh it's just hot why did you issue an alert day you know heat is the number one severe weather killer and it's because you know things happen so quickly heat exhaustion happens so fast and it's something you don't really expect that is why we issued the alert day because it'll it'll be the hottest day easily we've seen so far this year we've only hit 90 once in Cleveland so far this year Dan we have the potential to do it again today and then again on Friday and your advice to people and especially you start thinking about dogs and pets that are outside anything you can do for shade cool water if you can bring them inside that's the best case scenario I need to be keeping our eye out for our pets 19 First Alert meteorologist Kelly doback thank you for checking in thanks Dan all right take care as you've heard this is going to be an active weather day our team is on it we are going to be on it any warnings that pop up we're going to make sure that you are ahead of this but again that 19 First Alert weather app is so incredible because when there is a lightning 10 miles from you seven miles from you it's going to alert your phone you can see you can literally get on that app and watch the radar and watch that storm move through your area again stay on top of this today because we will be staying on top of it and helping you through this if we have any other breaking news we're going to bring it to you here on our digital properties otherwise I'll be anchoring our 11 o'clock news on CW 43 coming up as well as our noon news coming up on channel 19. until then I'm Dan Rose with 19 News have a good afternoon 19 news is everywhere download our CTV apps and

to having a mountain of seafood on your plate I have covered most buffets out here in Las Vegas but I did just recently do the most expensive Buffet so I figured let's do a full 180 and show off the cheapest one I'm getting pretty hungry let's go [Music] we're in Fremont Street well kind of technically we are really more on Main Street we are here at the Garden Court Buffet at the Main Street Station Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas so right now we are here during the weekday for their brunch buffet So today we're only going to be paying 23.99 that's pretty cheap guys definitely less expensive than anything on this trip and for sure cheaper than the most expensive place we went to so now that we know where we're sitting let's go get some food I don't think I want salad cold bread I know I know we're not supposed to do bread at a buffet but it looks delicious bacon I guess maybe this first place should be more breakfast [Music] can I get a little piece of ham I think it's enough so I didn't really think too much about it but the moment I hit the buffet line I don't know what it was but this brexit call my name and then once I grabbed it I was like no no let's be organized let's go ahead and get more breakfast stuff for this first play so I got a few items here and you know what this buffet was actually pretty big I had like a lot of different stations it looks like when you first come in they do have a salad station then you kind of circle around and you're gonna get more towards the breakfast item than the lunch items and then further on it has a dessert so again we are here for their brunch time so a little bit of both selections they had this ham right there that they just hand carved right there for you it looked really good not bad that is actually really good like it has a really nice amount of fat in it and it's like a little bit more on the flaky side right here but I actually really like that mmm when I first came in I actually really didn't even know what to expect just because it is on the more budget side but I mean first day so far pretty good let's try the other type of ham now which is bacon I really don't think you can mess up bacon but you never know let's see it is a little bit more on the dry side but honestly like it's still just fine I still be happy with this let's go ahead and try this chicken fried steak right here and what was actually pretty cool is that they had little portions of it right there and then topped off with gravy that's all right I mean I feel like it could use a little bit more of salt before it gets too cold I do want to try that breadstick that's so called my name kind of looks like an Olive Garden style breadstick oh that's pretty good I just need some marinara sauce or some ranch is that weird I like to dip my breadsticks in ranch but what do you guys think very buttery next we're going to try out their frittata I was actually really excited when I saw it because I really do love frittatas okay this is the inside of it right there I think they said this was a vegetable frittata so it looks like it has like some tomatoes onions mushrooms some greens it does kind of taste a little bit like it was made with like pre-made eggs like eggs maybe out of the carton the consistency itself it's kind of like a little bit more smooth a lot more than what like traditional eggs would taste like you know what it needs you need some cheese in there that's what I'm going to use then again I'm really glad that they made it into like individual portions that's cool then I did get some regular eggs too just in case you can definitely taste the butter in these runs you know what they kind of taste like you know when you go and you say like at a Best Western or any of those like hotels that comes with breakfast in the morning it kind of tastes like those eggs but I don't mean it in a bad way like that's actually a good thing like it brings me good memories so yeah I kind of end up liking the regular eggs better than the frittata and finally let's try this apple crepe we got the apples in there they're probably like out of a can honestly it kind of reminds me like of a McDonald's apple pie but a crepe instead of the pie shell so this is called The Garden Court Buffet which is actually really funny because the buffet over at the South Point Hotel I think it's also called Garden Court so maybe if you're meeting people make sure you clarify which one you're going to they do offer brunch every single day from 8 A.M till 2 p.m of course the weekdays are going to be a little bit cheaper at 23.99 and then on the weekends is 26.99 if you do have kids with you ages 4 to 10 they are half off of that price and then three and under are free now if you do want to do dinner though it is only on the weekends on Fridays and Saturdays from 4 P.M to 9 p.m and that's going to be 32.99 per person now the cool thing though is that if you're a part of their board rewards if you are the emerald and up which I think it is their second tier you do get three dollars off per person for this one they do not accept a reservation so it is just going to be walking but we got in pretty quick second plate time [Music] yes trade is here it's new coffee time I was starting to get the items so I definitely needed this energy boost I am so excited because I love discovering new coffees and Trade coffee is great since they work with over 55 of the top roasters so you can make your best cup at home oh I got energy just from smelling that they have flexible subscription plans and a diverse assortment of rows that get tailored to you it comes with free shipping customizable plans and you can cancel at any time and the best part is that the coffee is shipped to your house within 48 Hours of being roasted so it's always fresh okay I had to get out my pretty cup for this so this one says it's a medium rose with notes of caramel pecan and molasses oh that's a really nice roast nice so if you want to give them a try just make sure you click on the link down below so you can get a free bag of coffee with any subscription cheers okay oh now these are the warm ones I'm thinking we should get maybe more lunch style options ooh fried chicken mac and cheese so we have our second plate now and this is going to be more of the actual lunch options so it's funny once I started grabbing everything I noticed I was kind of building like a typical KFC style plate here so you got like your Mac and Cheese your mashed potatoes Fried Chicken a biscuit and I mean technically I don't think they serve yams at KFC but it's still southern style let's start off with the main piece which is going to be their chicken I love the ground has like a really nice crunchy outside I don't know about you guys but the wing is always my favorite part of the chicken like I could have wings all the time I'll be back for you sir next up I want to try their mashed potatoes right here and they did have some gravy right there too that you can pour over it I can't put my finger at it but it is a very flavorful gravy I know because like a chicken flavoring or something but it's pretty good and honestly the potatoes are very similar to those of KFC's try some mac and cheese here it looks actually really cheesy it's a red it's not too bad I do feel like it could be a little cheesier I'm gonna try now their biscuit here oh okay I should have grabbed butter it's okay oh that's good I hate to compare everything to KFC but I feel like this is like almost identical this is really good on its own but I think butter would have made it a little better and then finally the sweet potatoes or the yams I believe that's good I think we hear this the sugar maybe brown sugar or molasses even yeah that's definitely some burnt sugar what I do think is really cool is how beautiful this Buffet is like I've never seen a buffet that has like all these really nice lights all these amazing statues really nice chandeliers and even vintage style fans even check out this window this is so cool and those chandeliers itself they came from the San Francisco Opera House that were made back in 1850. so it really feels like we're at a buffet but like back in time and I mean even the rest of the hotel makes you feel like you're back in the 18 or early 1900s now something else that's really cool is that if you wanted to have some alcohol along with your brunch they do sell bottles of champagne for twenty dollars that's really cheap so it's like you could have a true Vegas style Mimosa brunch anytime now we're off to get our third plate which is usually my plate of Randomness so I'm just gonna get a little bit of everything chicken let's try kielbasa so this is my third plate of buffet Randomness I know they're just like some items that I saw there I was kind of curious about so this was a time to try them she probably should probably try the pizza first I did go ahead and add on a little bit of Parmesan cheese and peppers just to give it a little bit extra crunch it's honestly just okay I do personally think they needed to add just a little bit more marinara sauce into it I hate to show you guys not my favorite pizza I've tried in Vegas so next thing we're going to try is our shoyu chicken which it kind of looks like an Asian style type of chicken the chicken skin definitely looks uh crispy try just chicken itself first okay not bad I could definitely tell that's a thigh because it's a little bit more on the juicier and fattier side I can definitely taste kind of like the Asian style of sauce right there kind of like maybe like a soy and sugar type of sauce I really want to try this chicken skin wow it almost looks like Duck skin or something oh that's not too bad I do personally like chicken skin and sex skin so I you know I'll always enjoy it next step is going to be their kiabasa they did have that area where like you cut the ham and then they had different types of sausages they added Italian sausage as well but I don't know I never really had to kill bosses so I figured this is a place to try something different oh that was crunchy but like I bit it and it like it like popped right away it's like ASMR okay enough let's actually eat it now I've never really had kielbasa anywhere else do I can't really compare it to anything but it is like a little bit on the fatty side for me but that's really cool that they were able to have like other salad Cuisines here at this buffet and then of course I went ahead and I got some sort of fruit you know try to get a little bit of healthy stuff in this meal something I did kind of notice though over in that fruit section is that a lot of it was like canned salad fruits like I think they had like canned peaches or canned apples so this was like the only fresh one they had which was fresh cantaloupe and then they had pineapple too and just a little bit of Pineapple but not too much because then like it'll start like scraping my tongue I don't know it feels weird the cantaloupe is always good my last healthy buy before we get dessert saw a cheesecake over here Calling My Name found it ah what is this oh I gotta have this we've got all the sugar needed for the whole next week okay guys dessert is finally here so it did have a few selections there from like pies they had Cakes as well uh looks like different pastries and they even had this pudding right here which I just had to try they did have a frozen yogurt section that you can serve yourself onto a cone and then just dress up your ice cream too I do want to try this cheesecake first I don't know about you guys the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life I mean it's been a while but I remember really liking Jack-in-the-Box cheesecake as a kid I don't know let me know if you guys ever tried that might be comparing it to that although it's actually really good and it's really rich too look how thick that is I'm very surprised by their cheesecake I really do like it and they also did have a bread pudding there kind of really looks more like flan honestly yeah look how much and sugary that is that is very moist I am not sleeping for 48 hours after having this I like it though it is like a really nice texture for this bread pudding so I did get this because usually this is one of my favorite type of desserts because it has like the whipped cream on the inside and sometimes it'll have kind of like a creme on Glenn here oh my God that's some sweet whipped cream I do like the creme angle that's on the inside like if it was up to me I would put way more cremon gray and then like less whipped cream and then finally some chocolate pudding look how jiggly it is it kind of just tastes like yeah like those snack packs or like the jello ones where it was like chocolate and then like had like a lighter chocolate in the middle not sure I don't hate it I feel like I'm 10 years old again in school I'm pretty full guys so this was the cheapest buffet that was on the touristy Las Vegas area so between the strip and downtown yes there are other buffets of course like in Chinatown like in South Point some other casinos that are a little bit cheaper but you know I did want to keep you guys in the more Central Area you know I don't want to have to send you super far into the city where like your Uber costs more than the actual food so if you want something that's pretty nearby then Main Street is the place for you this was my first time dining here at the Main Street Buffet so I just wanted to show you guys a different options so that way you guys can decide of coming to this Buffet is worth so if you have tried it let me know so as always guys please make sure you give this video a thumbs up subscribe share it with your friends and comment below tell me what's your favorite buffet in Las Vegas thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you next time we came downtown no that sounds weird definitely less expensive than anything on this trip and dip okay nah I'm saying definitely too much I probably should have gotten a warm plate oh well yeah I'm gonna I'm just gonna freeze all my food no that one's cold too okay [Applause] so again we are here for their brunch out here for their brunch time why am I getting this one [Music] I'm gonna cry let's let many noises in here and then if you want to do dinner it is only going to be on the weekends on Fridays and Saturdays now if you do want to do dinner it is only going to be on Fridays and Saturdays from 4 P.M until however though if you don't want to get the oh hold on [Music] we did not get the most aesthetic table here it's a lot of families here let me just say that [Music] okay enough let's actually eat it now they did also have a self-serve frozen yogurt place that you can surf what are we saying squishy at the bottom [Music] I know I'm sorry I'm cheating I'm taking off most of the whipped cream off of here so as always guys oh my Lord I'm gonna cry so as always guys please make sure you give this video a thumbs up subscribe share with your friends and comment below tell me if you've been to it now [Music] I don't think I'm opening it right do I need scissors silence

Davidson did what no Police Department would recommend he confronts the suspected thief and gets a face full of bear mace I almost hit him it was close but that not just too much I just couldn't uh I couldn't see I couldn't breathe I couldn't anything Tacoma Police responded in both cases say they have detectives working the case but in the meantime the shop on the south end is taking no chances I'm constantly walking you know looking for suspicious activity I see things where there are things you know now so yeah I'm nervous as heck you know I really am hopeful someone recognizes and turns in this suspected coin-op burglar it's the most horrible experience I've ever been through in my life that bear mace is no joke in Tacoma Sebastian Robertson King 5 News

The City of Tacoma gave Bridge Point Tacoma LLC, part of Bridge Industrial, the green light to redevelop around 160 acres into a warehouse distribution center with about two-and-a-half million square feet of building space.

customers I'd like to throw them at others while floating down the river in partnership with the Tonto National Forest and the Maricopa County Sheriff's office Salt River Tubing tells us they're trying to keep the environment clean and safe and tubers can be cited for littering I never understood why people did that but I don't I don't have an issue with it but I guess if there's a band this probably is not cool for the environment but marshmallows are very sticky very nasty for the environment birds eat them everybody eats them and it's just this is not a good thing steffel also asked to

Iris thermosio highs have been at 110 or hotter every single day this month in fact we're at 31 straight days with Highs at 110 or more as that Trend started at the end of June but we may finally break the streak on this last day of the month with Phoenix chopping out at 107 degrees so just below that 110 Mark as we see storm chances ramp up highs in the 80's to 90s across Northern Arizona and shy of 110-2 out at Lake Havasu City storm chances go up by the early afternoon over the High Country and then by late afternoon into the evening we start to see that better storm potential in the valley right now it looks like our best chances will come between about 5 and 10 p.m with more storms across the valley possibly and finally some measurable rain at Phoenix Sky Harbor which we haven't had despite all of the storms that we have seen in the last couple of days 107 for a high today 108 tomorrow then those storm chances really drop off through the end of the week and it's going to get hotter as a result highs will be near 1 15 this upcoming weekend for the latest headlines weather and traffic head to cc50.com or download that free ABC 15 mobile app this ABC 15 flash briefing is

on this announcement today it is a major announcement for us here at the Glendale Police Department um I want to start off by saying that there's a lot of mixed emotions with this particular announcement that we're having we are happy and at the same time we're hopeful that we will be able to supply this family a little bit more closure with that I would like to tell you that Alicia Navarro has been located she is by all count safe she is by all accounts healthy and she is by all accounts happy she was located in a very small town in Montana near the Canadian border we can tell you that she went to a local police department in that area she identified herself as Alicia Navarro and at that point our officers went into investigation mode we conducted several types of interviews and not only through those interviews but through the help of Alicia's family themselves we are confident that the person that we are talking with and are dealing with is indeed Alicia Navarro um I can't even begin to express to you all The Pride that I personally have in the men and women here at our Police Department since her Discovery our men and women here have been working tirelessly around the clock to not only bring closure to this family but to make sure that Alicia gets everything that she possibly needs I'm also going to bring up Lieutenant Scott Waite it's his team that has been leading this investigation here we'll have a few words thank you Jose again Lieutenant Scott White Glendale Police Department I don't think you can put enough words in uh the joy that we feel knowing earlier this week when we received a call to Alicia Navarro had identified herself to police officers in Montana not only the relief and joy for us for Alicia for her family and for our community there hasn't been I think anybody that hasn't known this investigation that hasn't put themselves in the same spot as Alicia her family and the emotions that they must be going through not only back in 2019 when this occurred but in the last few days with that we want you to know that we are continuing to investigate we immediately responded to the area and with the help of the United States Marshal Service as well as the FBI we've been able to continue this investigation to make contact with Alicia to reunite her with her family and only begin to put together the puzzle which is her disappearance and her returning I would ask patients not only for us as law enforcement and this investigation but patience for Alicia and for her family we can only imagine what she's going through mentally emotionally as well as her family and as much as we'd like to to say this is the end we know this is probably only the beginning of where this investigation will go and that we will continue to work with our state local Federal partners and even across state lines to make sure that Alicia has everything that she needs that she's taken care of that her family is getting the help that they need and that most importantly that this investigation is completed thoroughly and done correctly thank you just to quickly Echo what Lieutenant wait just said it is this case is far from over we do have the resolution that we have located Alicia but there's still a lot of questions that will still need to be answered there's still a lot of investigating that our not only our employees have to do but as well as these other partnering agencies so once again we are asking that you all have patience with us we will supply information as it becomes available and we also have a message from Alicia herself who is asking for privacy this has been a traumatic situation for her as you can imagine but she is looking to be able to move on in her life she's looking to build a life for herself and she's asking for some privacy and patience as well with that we will open the Florida questions she with anyone right now we don't know if she's been with anyone for the length of time that she's been missing uh we're still investigating that actively we can tell you that when she showed up to the police department she was by herself she has been by herself each time and she's been cooperative you put these puzzle pieces together oh we certainly don't want to eliminate any options um from the statements that she made this started as a runaway situation she reiterated as much but they're of course more Dynamic Supply is you start to put together the puzzle um I would say that all options are on the table and we want to not discount anything until we've done a full complete investigation and also I want to point out that we have Phil Bates with the FBI here that is also willing to answer any questions that you might have she 14 at the time she just she is getting ready to turn 19. so she's currently 18 years old she went missing in the middle of September of 2019 and her birthday was a couple days after she went missing how did she get to Montana uh we don't know yet that's certainly part of the investigation and answers that we're hoping to get from Alicia herself I'm sorry how old is she now she is 18. she's getting ready to turn 19 in September did she show up to that Police Department alone uh yeah so when she came to the police department she did come alone as our detectives and as the local PD up there have talked with her I met with her she's always been alone did you say the name of the town at this time we're not going to release that information not only out of respect for Alicia her privacy but this is a very small town we can tell you that it is close to the Canadian border it's about 40 miles from the Canadian border in Montana and uh they are working alongside us to help resolve all the questions that we have in this case so out of respect for the investigation as well as the respect for Alicia's privacy is anyone facing charges currently or could anyone potentially face charges I mean there's always the potential that somebody could face charges as this investigation unfolds and we get more clarification on what happened to her that's certainly a possibility but I can't say that there's anything imminent or Petty at this time you mentioned she turns herself into a police department would that be Montana she was in Montana turning herself in is a strong statement she showed up to a police department she identified herself as Alicia Navarro and she basically asked for help to clear her off of a missing juvenile list she by all accounts went on her own free will she is not in any kind of trouble she's not facing any kind of charges she is not being held anywhere she is coming and going at her own free will and she has been extremely Cooperative with not only our folks but our federal Partners as well does she want to come back to Arizona um I still think it's really early in her healing process as to where she wants to stay and that's certainly up to her and we will help her in any way possible to make sure that she is in her best situation in the most comfortable this she could possibly be I know that her mom has been searching for her since she went with you said that he were able to reunite her family and her were you there for that can you describe what that was like I emotionally overwhelming not only for the mother but for Alicia herself with respect to the family I'm not going to go into the specifics on how that reunification was done but I can say for everybody involved including the detectives is extremely overwhelming which family members were there the first notification was to her mother and that was the first notification and I would say reunification that's happened the investigation of ready to Cave Montana so throughout the last few years there's been a lot of tips leads citizen upon citizen who's wanted to help with this investigation and I can tell you that each tip and Lead were looked into that's just specifics where there were any in Montana I would have to look back and see but I know that there are some that span across all parts of this country we just don't know the answer to that question right now right now those are some of the questions that we have um she's she's overwhelmed she's overwhelmed she realizes that there's been a lot of attention on this case she is very knowledgeable as far as that's concerned right now her priority is to work with us she wanted to talk to her mom and she wanted to make sure her mother knew she was okay and we're taking it day by day step by step with her you know it's important to tag along to what Lieutenant wait just said with this case there were literally thousands of tips that would come in on this case this has been going on for nearly 40 years now and every one of those tips every one of those possibilities were looked into investigated and we're just happy to say that she did indeed come forward and we are very we feel very strongly that this is Alicia I know she had let them know before she left do we know that or can we confirm that she did indeed leave her house voluntarily from every indication that she's given us and again it's very early in the investigation and I need to stress again patience and that it is early but every indication she's given us so far is that she willfully left her home her own free will and choice now the Dynamics surrounding that decision are obviously something that we're looking into I know we have an FBI representative here I don't know who wants to share his role this is Phil Bates as with every missing juvenile case the FBI assist our state and local partners with intelligence gathering and with other resources as necessary that's no different in this case we provide a support to the Glendale Police Department and will continue to support both here in Arizona and in Montana for the next steps in a case like this obviously she's safe and happy and healthy at this point no indication that anybody is being charged with any sort of crime but one of the next steps what is your investigation look like from here complex uh it's multifaceted there's two parts to it and any investigation like this there's a criminal element of course there is we want to search and find the answers if there was any Criminal intent behind it certainly not from her but from others involved and then there's also the assistant side of it to us she is a victim and we need to provide services to her whether that be mental or just health-wise or just helping her get her life back in order so there's certainly a lot of different things that we want to make sure not only for Alicia but her family that we cover all the steps that we can I can say that she didn't require any immediate medical attention or any medical attention since we've been with her again I think Jose well she seems happy and healthy to the extent that she can be given the circumstance but that's certainly something that we want to help provide for her and make sure if she hasn't seen a doctor in the last few years that those are things that we are able to provide for and make sure that she has everything necessary to really move on with her life and enjoy the rest of her life was there any social media involvement in things that we can speak on when she first left somebody who probably did speak to her and convince her to house through social media could that be the case um so that's part of any investigation that was obviously part of the initial investigation the family was very supportive and cooperative and providing whatever information that they had as to her we'll call social media fingerprint and what she was using I can tell you that we follow those leads extensively we continue to follow them we continue to look back from the very day minute hour that she left and try and go down every lead that we can to see if that'll provide answers and certainly now that hasn't stopped and will continue any inclination of why now and a lot of these cases don't turn out like this so can you tell us your reaction as well I think for Alicia is that she felt like now was the time that whether it's emotionally mentally that she wants to take the next steps in her life she's expressed a desire to move forward in life and do the things that a normal healthy adult would do and we certainly want to help her get those so I can't say that there's any single triggering moment I think there's probably been a long progression for her in the journey that she's taken and we are more than happy um ready and willing to help her do the rest of her path yes she is still there with the local police up there with our investigators and we are continuing to help her in whatever way we can can you tell us when she went to a police department was it within the last few days within the last few years once we wrap up this press conference we will be emailing out to your guests a photograph that was taken of her when she arrived at the police department I will tell you uh just to be direct it will look she doesn't look much different than she did when she disappeared she is 18 years old she's getting ready to turn 19 but her appearance is still that of a very young looking young lady besides the photograph that we will be releasing we will send two very small video clips of some of the very small portion of interviews that were done by our officers via FaceTime prior to seeing her face to face Alicia is by all accounts again she just appears to be in good spirits she really just wants to move on with her life she is very apologetic to what she has put her mother through has expressed that and she stands that she caused a lot of pain to her mother and it was not intentional on her behalf and she's hopeful that they can have a relationship

wanted to give you an update regarding zillow's forecast for the coming year now we all know the housing market has been going through its ups and downs in the past 12 months where the market was extremely hot but when interest rates kept going up demand cooled off severely and last November interest rates got around seven percent and then the turn of the Year happened and all of 2023. interest rates have been around a high sixes low sevens for the entire time now that is the over opposite of what a year and a half ago when interest rates were in the threes fours and Bots you have to hear this forecast because it even blew it even shocked me and I consider myself a moderate regarding the housing market Zillow has shown to be a complete board going into next year if you don't know what that means stick around because we're going to get into it [Music] now Zillow predicts that 48 of the top 200 markets here in the United States will see an appreciation of above seven percent in the next 12 months that is absolutely insane coming along of the backs of the pandemic where in the last three years you've seen an over 40 percent increase in whole values in the last three years as they're saying within the next year you're going to see an additional seven percent increase in all balance in 48 of the top 200 metros in our country and now the average appreciation for years right around four or five percent so seven percent is a very hot market and I believe it's very bullish I don't agree with everything Zillow was saying but I do believe that these circumstances which surrounds the housing market that cause them to be very Flawless do exist so it will not surprisingly if prices did go up no I don't think they're going to go up seven percent but let's go on and talk about what Zillow also predicts for the rest of the country from June 2023 to June 2024 Zillow predicts that Baton Rouge Louisiana will go up 9.8 year over here and that Fayetteville North Carolina will go up 8.7 percent year over year another number that shocked me was that they saw that Durham Chapel Hill area of North Carolina will go up 7.3 from June 2023 to June 2024 and overall as a country they think home values will increase on average 6.3 percent nationally now again normal appreciation for any given year and the housing market is anywhere from four to five point three percent they're saying that the average for next year even with these high interest rates is going to be 6.3 percent now the reason why they're calling for such an aggressive flush in home equity is what I've been telling you for much now severely low supply of inventory coupled with more formations of households you're seeing more people more Millennials more gen Z's Coming of Age wanting to buy a home well you get more people more buyers into the market with still a limited number of homes for sale that is going to cause prices to go up when you think about the housing market you have to think about human behavior you can't just think about numbers like you would any other commodity and whether you want to admit it or not when humans get a certain age they want to form families and when they form a family they want to have a foundation and buy a home and that has more people in the market looking for homes even in this High interest rate environment will cry compared to what it was a year and a half ago or two years ago you're still seeing people that are able willing and ready to buy even though that that demand is depressed that demand is still much higher than the supply of homes available on the market until we get the inventory or Supply demand equation Under Wraps home prices and home values will continue shooting up because there's more formations of homes every single day that people looking to buy homes every single day and in the article we're talked about the home appreciation that Zillow expects they saw the greatest appreciation at least what I noticed in areas with right now presently average or median home prices for the country we're not seeing the areas where home prices are already skyrocketed to an astronomical amount seeing these eight nine percent increases that Zillow are saying with the average home is more along the line of the median home price here in our country so people are going to flock to Affordable areas and those affordable areas are going to become unaffordable because it's going to cause more demand and strain on the market causing prices to go up now real quick now we'll get back to the video I'll wrap it up shortly but I want you to see these views of Manhattan right now Zillow also thinks that home prices have bottomed meaning we will not see a housing crash they believe home prices bottom earlier this year in February so if they're correct oil prices will remain flat and or go up and as we've see they're predicting the home prices will go up 6.3 percent year over year from this June to next June now zillow's not alone thinking that corn prices have bottomed for logic and the AEI housing center also believe that home prices have bought while other data firms thinks that porn prices still have a little bit to give such as Moody's analytica and Morgan Stanley they think prices will go down a little bit as we get into the fall and winter months now me personally I think that that is what's going to happen the man is going to fall off the cliff in the winter months which they typically does every single foreign winter home prices drop and I think that's no different this year right now because we saw that last year where the beginning of the year the first half of 2022 we were on Pace to have 10 appreciation year over year but we ended up finishing the year right around five so we saw home prices dip for the second half of the year and I think that's what's going to happen this year as well especially if interest rates remain high now if interest rates go down who knows home prices may go to the moon but if interest rates remain elevated I believe that's going to have a huge impact on demand especially because if people can choose nobody really wants to move during the fall and winter and during the holidays only people that are moving during that time are people that have to meet or people that are looking for a very good deal so if you're looking to buy a home and have been priced out of the market and couldn't get your offer accepted the fall and winter times when less people are looking and motivated sellers are selling is an opportunity for you to step in and get your offering considered if not accepted so while I think home prices will go down in the second half of the year do I think they're going to crash no I don't think they're going to crash they're going to go down anywhere from three to seven percent but I don't see that as a crash if you have any questions regarding the housing market don't hesitate to reach out to me I am sir Ashley your real estate advisor all the contact information is in the description below I look forward to hearing from you talk soon foreign [Music]

0neZBZ9B,Raleigh Review,did you have dramatic the lady was totally bullshit. love that drama,Roxboro Resident Seeks Redress Over Controversial No-Knock Raid: Sparks an Urgent Call for Police Reform,https://newsbreak.com/n/0neZBZ9B,Roxboro woman wants apology as emotional scars linger from 'SWAT-style' raid of her home,"Months after her home was rushed by police, a Roxboro woman is still shaken by the events of Jan. 6, 2023. Shayla Tapp said that the Roxboro Police Department executed a 'no-knock' warrant and underwent a 'SWAT-style' raid at her home on that date. Tapp is now asking for a change in policy and a formal apology. Tapp said she was in the shower when police knocked down her door, held her naked on the floor and searched her home. She was initially charged with a misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The district attorney later dropped the charges in the case. Mike Waters' dismissal notes said body camera footage showed the search warrant being served in a no-knock manner, despite there being no suspicion of drug trafficking or drug trade. Members of the Granville County NAACP joined Tapp and her attorney at a press conference on Thursday at Roxboro City Hall. They argue this warrant never should have been served. Tapp said it stemmed from an issue about an alleged theft of a dog. Police came to her home to take back the dog and then returned later with the warrant for the marijuana misdemeanor charge. Tapp said she's been diagnosed with PTSD after the incident, which has taken a heavy emotional toll on her. ‘This situation has changed me,"" Tapp said. ""I cannot trust the police. I do not sleep at night. I am terribly afraid. I would not want this to happen to anybody, nobody, not my worst enemy."" ""I just want to be myself again,"" she added. Attorney Abraham Rubert-Schewel said that no 911 call or police report of the matter exists. In a statement, Roxboro Police Chief Davis Hess said 'I am confident the video shows officers knocking and announcing on the front door, then after no response, went to the back door and did the same thing before entering with a lawfully obtained search warrant."" Tapp said her doors are still off their hinges and the home still has significant damage from the raid.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted on July 18 that ""Jack Smith is a lousy attorney ... He only targets Republicans because he's a weak little b---- for the Democrats."" Allies of former President Donald Trump have rallied around him ahead of a potential second federal indictment, portraying special counsel Jack Smith as having a partisan ax to grind. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was among Trump’s defenders trying to discredit Smith, who has been investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn legitimate 2020 election results and separately prosecuted Trump in the classified documents case, in which a grand jury indicted him in June. ""Jack Smith is a lousy attorney,"" Greene tweeted July 18. ""His career is filled with mistrials, overturned cases, and judicial rebukes. He only targets Republicans because he’s a weak little b---- for the Democrats."" Like any public corruption prosecutor, Smith has had some wins and losses; whether he is ""lousy"" is an opinion. But Greene’s statement that Smith ""only targets Republicans"" is wrong. The phrase she tweeted, ""mistrials, overturned cases, and judicial rebukes,"" is essentially the same phrase used in the headline of The Washington Times, a conservative newspaper. And that article said: ""Mr. Smith’s team followed the same playbook in the Trump case as in other high-stakes political prosecutions of both Republicans and Democrats."" By saying Smith ""only targets Republicans,"" Greene also ignores how a special counsel operates. U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland appointed Smith in November to lead two investigations involving Trump. Garland did so because of Trump’s announcement that he was running for president and President Joe Biden’s expected re-election campaign. That means Smith didn’t choose to ""target"" Trump; Smith was hired to investigate Trump’s actions. When Smith was appointed, he was prosecuting war crimes in Kosovo, far from any U.S. political melodrama. Smith has a decadeslong career as a prosecutor, starting in New York in the 1990s. From 2010 to 2015, he was chief of the Justice Department’s public integrity section, where his office went after politicians of both parties.

They made it nearly half a mile to a house on Wright Road. That's where they were later shot for attacking the homeowner's chickens. A Moore County man is upset with a neighbor who shot and killed his family's dogs. The dogs reportedly got out and attacked the neighbor's chickens. On Saturday, Steven Craig said his two dogs dug a hole under a fence and escaped. They made it nearly half a mile to a house on Wright Road. That's where they were later shot for attacking the homeowner's chickens. Craig said he spent hours looking for his 9-year-old lab, Max, and his grandson's 8-month-old Australian Shepherd/lab mix puppy. His son was continuing the search late Saturday night when he heard gunfire. ""He heard two gunshots, fearing that it might have been a neighbor shooting the dogs,"" Craig said. According to a report from the Moore County Sheriff's Office, the homeowner came home, heard his pigs squealing in his backyard, saw chicken feathers in the front yard and grabbed his rifle. He told police two dogs were in his backyard attacking the chickens, so he shot them. The report stated 18 chickens were killed or missing. ""If they had time enough to kill 18 chickens, he had enough time to chase them away,"" Craig said. Under state law, property owners are within their rights to kill a dog that is killing poultry. Craig doesn't dispute that, but he said it could have been handled differently. ""I feel he could have warned them,"" Craig said. When WRAL's Shelle Jackson went to the chicken owners' home, chickens were roaming free in the front yard and there was a hole in the fence. A person who answered the door at the home where the chickens were kept on Tuesday declined to comment. Craig said he's an animal lover, and he feels bad about the chickens, but wishes there could have been a non-violent resolution. ""Dogs are pets, chickens are livestock,"" Craig said. ""I could have paid to replace those chickens. But you can't replace the life of the dog.""

0nboiqcr,Raleigh Review,normal temps,"Extreme Heatwave Returns to North Carolina , Feels-Like Temperatures Could Exceed 105 Degrees",https://newsbreak.com/n/0nboiqcr,"North Carolina Forecast: Extreme heat makes a comeback Tuesday, temps back in the triple digits","After a short break, the heat is back. Temperatures will be back in the 90s Tuesday, and the heat index will make it feel even hotter. As you head out the door Tuesday morning, temperatures are in the 70s. Here's your fitness forecast for the day. If you are planning on spending time outdoors, try to get out this morning to beat the heat. Whether you're inside or outside -- but especially if you're outside -- drink plenty of water to help prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Tuesday will begin with mostly sunny skies, but clouds are expected to move in later this afternoon. They will hold the heat in check -- a little bit. There's a very slight chance for an isolated shower or storm Tuesday afternoon. The rest of the week is looking relatively dry, which is good news for baseball fans. The Bulls will be back in Durham this week for their first three home games of the season. If you're heading to any of these games on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, the forecast is looking good. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday bring much of the same: Sun in the morning, clouds in the afternoon, and temperatures gradually climbing to the mid-90s.

0nb5sjUo,Raleigh Review,FAKE NEWS . JACK SMITH IS FULL OF 💩.,Debunked : Jack Smith Partisan Accusations Unfounded,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nb5sjUo,Fact check: Greene says Trump prosecutor Jack Smith only targets Republicans,"U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tweeted on July 18 that ""Jack Smith is a lousy attorney ... He only targets Republicans because he's a weak little b---- for the Democrats."" Allies of former President Donald Trump have rallied around him ahead of a potential second federal indictment, portraying special counsel Jack Smith as having a partisan ax to grind. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was among Trump’s defenders trying to discredit Smith, who has been investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn legitimate 2020 election results and separately prosecuted Trump in the classified documents case, in which a grand jury indicted him in June. ""Jack Smith is a lousy attorney,"" Greene tweeted July 18. ""His career is filled with mistrials, overturned cases, and judicial rebukes. He only targets Republicans because he’s a weak little b---- for the Democrats."" Like any public corruption prosecutor, Smith has had some wins and losses; whether he is ""lousy"" is an opinion. But Greene’s statement that Smith ""only targets Republicans"" is wrong. The phrase she tweeted, ""mistrials, overturned cases, and judicial rebukes,"" is essentially the same phrase used in the headline of The Washington Times, a conservative newspaper. And that article said: ""Mr. Smith’s team followed the same playbook in the Trump case as in other high-stakes political prosecutions of both Republicans and Democrats."" By saying Smith ""only targets Republicans,"" Greene also ignores how a special counsel operates. U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland appointed Smith in November to lead two investigations involving Trump. Garland did so because of Trump’s announcement that he was running for president and President Joe Biden’s expected re-election campaign. That means Smith didn’t choose to ""target"" Trump; Smith was hired to investigate Trump’s actions. When Smith was appointed, he was prosecuting war crimes in Kosovo, far from any U.S. political melodrama. Smith has a decadeslong career as a prosecutor, starting in New York in the 1990s. From 2010 to 2015, he was chief of the Justice Department’s public integrity section, where his office went after politicians of both parties.

surprise is the speed of the change climate change is here it is terrifying and it is just the beginning the idea of global warming has ended the area the era of global boiling has arrived from global warning to Global boiling joining us now is journalist Jeff Goodell and writer of the new book The Heat will kill you first Jeff thanks for being with us to talk about this very heavy topic happy to be here well you know a lot of folks for a lot of folks this is hard to confront I mean I still you know divisive lines but as we continue to live through these extreme conditions it's hard to argue the world the climate the planet's changing in your book you actually talk about this chain saying that we have left the quote Goldilocks zone what do you mean by that well the Goldilocks zone is a phrase that scientists use who are looking for life on other planets um they're looking for the presence of liquid water that's a good sign that it might be life if it's too cold the water is ice if it's too hot it's been vaporized and it's not there so they call this sort of life-giving Zone the Goldilocks zone and I use that in my book to talk about how you know all life on this planet including us of course but but everything else around us grew up in this sort of stable climate range that we're very good at dealing with but as our climate heats up we're moving out of that range and it's becoming more and more difficult for humans to handle that kind of extreme temperatures that we're now moving into and that's the key word extreme it's high highs and low lows and they're just drastic and coming at times that we don't expect this type of weather or weather phenomenon to happen many scientists have been warning about climate change for years but as we heard the head of the United Nations say they're surprised that the speed that it's all happening are you shocked by this as well yes and no I mean uh this the warming has been predicted by climate scientists for a very long time and what we're seeing now is within the range of that kind of warming that they've been talking about but it's very difficult to predict you know uh immediate events you know near-term events extreme events where these kinds of heat waves will pop up how long exactly they will last those kinds of things you know weather is a very chaotic system and so in the in the immediate sense um there's I think I'm surprised in a lot of others that like I'm here in Texas it's been extremely hot here for a couple of weeks and the sort of length and duration of these of these heat waves I think is catching Everybody by surprise and given the mounting empirical evidence that's right in front of us how do you explain how there are still naysayers about climate change well there's a lot of reasons why people you know are skeptical about climate change and going from you know uh their financial interests some people are invested in various Industries oil and gas most primary among them that you know are do not stand to benefit from a world that takes climate change seriously to ideological reasons you know one of the things that's really happened in the you know I've been writing about climate change for 20 years and one of the things that's really shifted is it used to be an economic argument it used to be oh you know moving to renewable energy is too expensive when you can't afford the subsidies we can't afford to build solar and wind and things like that that's been reversed now solar and wind and Renewables are by far the cheapest way to create energy but the climates you know debate now has shifted into the sort of culture wars that we see in America between the left and the right you know this idea of woke culture and you know there's been a real attempt to undermine you know science itself we saw that during covid and it's happening again certainly become political will scientists say it's evident that humans contributed to this climate change where to blame came to a degree so if that's the case if mankind caused it how can we reverse it well we're not going to reverse it we're not going to go back to the climate that you and I and everybody who's watching this grew up in we're moving into a new climate realm no matter what we do but we can have a lot of impact on how bad it gets and the primary thing to do is to eliminate as fast as possible uh the burning of fossil fuels to recognize that we're in a kind of climate emergency that these extreme events are going to get worse and worse until we get serious about eliminating fossil fuels and then we need to adapt our cities and and places where we live to these extreme events you know getting air conditioning more accessible to more people more green spaces and cities more access to sort of public Cooling and most of all getting smart about the risks of extreme heat which I think are widely underestimated those are some great tips and advice for people who may feel hopeless about climate change about little small incremental things they could do to help the environment help Stave off things as they continue to deteriorate great Jeff Goodell who just wrote the new book The Heat will kill you and across the country a lot of folks can feel like that's a very true statement certainly not as Extreme as the we've been seeing out in the West in some areas but

GOMEZ, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. HELLO TO YOU. >> A PLEASURE BEING HERE WITH YOU HOPE EVERYONE IS HAVING A GREAT THING. OKAY. LET'S TRY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TOUGH ABOUT THIS AND EXPLAIN TO FOLKS WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. >> LOURDES DUARTE: OBVIOUSLY FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS, SUPERINTENDENT FRED WALLER INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT HAS SORT OF LED THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN THE MEANTIME, YOUR COMMISSION HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A PERMANENT POLICE SUPERINTENDENT. WHERE ARE WE IN THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW? >> THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE COMING TO THE PROCESS. WE'RE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO THE CONCLUSION OF SEARCH FOR THE FINAL SUPERINTENDENT. MAKE MY COMMISSION, THE COMMUNITY COMMISSION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WAS IN CHARGE OF THE MENTION OF CONDUCTING THE NATION. WHY SEARCH? AND WE'VE ACTUALLY NARROWED IT DOWN NOW TO 3 FINAL CANDIDATES. THOSE CANDIDATES HAVE NOW PRESENTED TO MIR JOHNSON PRESENTED 14 THIS MONTH AND HE HAS NOW 30 DAY SINCE A 14 TO DECIDE BETWEEN THE 3 CANDIDATES. SEE SHAWN BARNES. HE'S A LITTLE RECENTLY. WE THINK THESE DISCIPLINARY CHARACTERS. REALLY EMBODY WHAT A GREAT LEADER, GREAT YEARS. AND WE'LL BE EXEMPLARY I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. AND WE HOPE THAT THE MAYOR WILL MAKE A SELECTION >> LOURDES DUARTE: OKAY. YEAH. SO WE COULD FIND OUT HERE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS RIGHT? >> YEAH, WE'RE A PRETTY CLOSE AND HOW WE'RE REALLY EXCITED. THERE'S A POSSIBILITY A VERY SLIM THAT THE MAYOR MAY REQUEST FOR PROCESS TO START OVER. WE ARE REALLY ANTICIPATING THAT THIS POSSIBLE COME TO AN END THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. OKAY. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE 3 CANDIDATES AND WHAT THEY MAY BRING TO THE LET YOU GET STARTED. YOU KNOW, ONE THAT WE KNOW HERE ON IS >> LOURDES DUARTE: MISTER, NO WE ACTUALLY FEATURED HIM AS PART OF THE STORY FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH. LET'S START WITH HIM. NOT THAT THE YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH THE COMMUNITY. WHAT WHAT ELSE WE KNOW ABOUT HIM? >> KNOW THAT HE HAS HAD AND HE REALLY CLEARING DEPARTMENT IN THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE KNOW THAT HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT SPEND THE MOST INVOLVED TEAM GETTING THE DEPARTMENT CLOSER TO COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE THAT LAWSUIT THAT CHICAGO HAS NOW COME TO AN AGREEMENT THE NEED TO BRING ABOUT POLICE REFORM. SO HE'S BEEN A KEY PLAYER IN THAT PART OF THE DEPARTMENT. HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB AND MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS HE'S A PART OF THAT PROCESS. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE HIM AS ONE OF THE FINALISTS. HE BRINGS A DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE, SPOKE NOT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S. ALSO BELIEVE POLICING LOOKS LIKE IN CHICAGO THE REST OF THE NATION. OKAY. WHO ELSE IS ON THAT LIST? ANOTHER GREAT CANDIDATE FROM THE CITY OF CHICAGO IS MISTER LARRY SNELLING. HE HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AS WELL, MANY YEARS DECADES REALLY WORKING IN THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING FROM BEING A PART OF THE TRAINING THAT A LOT OF THE OFFICERS HAVE UNDERGONE THE POLICE ACADEMY, KNOW, BEING THE LEADER OF THE BUREAU THAT AND THERE'S THAT COUNTRY, TERRORISM AND, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING FROM AIRPORT SECURITY TO SOME OF THE REALLY IMPACTFUL SECURITY EFFORTS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO HASS. AND THEN LAST SOMEONE THAT COMES WITH A LOT OF THOSE AND HE'S SOMEONE THAT COMES A LOT OF SUPPORT. ALSO FROM FROM THE COMMUNITY HAVING BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH THE SOUTHSIDE COMMUNITY, THAT HE WAS A COMMANDER. ALL RIGHT. AND THEN LAST ON THE LIST IS MISTER BARNES. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIM. >> HE'S THE ONE CANDIDATE THAT DOESN'T COME FROM INSIDE OF POLICE DEPARTMENT. HE IS ACTUALLY THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF MADISON, WISCONSIN. WE UNDERSTAND THE MEDICINE IN VERY DIFFERENT CITIES THAT THESE VERY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. YOU REALLY THINK HE'S ONE OF THE TOP IN OUR SURGE BECAUSE HE HAS JUST A BREATH OF KNOWLEDGE HAS SO SUCH A GOOD PERSPECTIVE WHAT THINK SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN TODAY'S COMPLICATED WORLD. SO HE'S SOMEONE THAT REALLY, REALLY SEES HIMSELF A LEADER AS AN INTELLECTUAL HAS GREAT RECORD, GREAT REFERENCES. AND WE THINK HE'S ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE'S IN THE FINAL TOP 3 OF ARTIST. >> LOURDES DUARTE: YEAH, THEY ALL SOUND LIKE REMARKABLE WE'LL SEE WHERE WE END UP HERE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN IMPORT INTO PICKING THE NEXT SUPERINTENDENT. YOU'VE BEEN OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO FOLKS. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM, FOR EXAMPLE, THE LATINO COMMUNITY AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A SUPERINTENDENT AND HOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN PLAY A BIGGER ROLE IN KEEPING THEIR COMMUNITY SAFE. >> WE DEFINITELY HEARD A LOT FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AS YOU MENTIONED, YOU WITH US AND WE ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR HAVING A LEADER CAN INSPIRE BOTH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE RANKS OF THE POLICE. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE NECESSITY TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEX ISSUES THAT ARE FACING CHICAGO. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO SEE THAT IS FACING SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF CRIME OF VIOLENCE, BUT ALSO SEE THAT REALLY USE AND THEY'RE GOING AND INTERNAL AN EXTERIOR PROCESS REFORMING ITSELF IN BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE THINK THAT WE HAVE FROM 3 CANDIDATES THAT REALLY STAND UP TO THE CHALLENGE THEY'RE LIKELY GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DELIVER THOSE. WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES WITH THE WAY THAT OFFICERS INTERACT WITH THE COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY WITH THE DIVERSE, VARIETY OF LANGUAGES THAT WE HAVE. THERE'S STILL A GAP THAT NEEDS TO BE HELD BETWEEN HOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND POLICE COMMUNICATE AS WAS JUST IN GENERAL. WE HAVE A PLETHORA THE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, LIKE THE CRISIS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING HOUSE IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. SO WE REALLY THINK THIS IS A MOMENT FOR LEADERSHIP. MOMENT FOR A CHANGE IN A MOMENT WHERE THE COMMUNITY ACTUALLY SAW SOLD AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE PROCESS OF SELECTION. SO WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF LEGITIMACY THAT'S GOING TO COME FROM THAT. AND WE THINK THAT THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN SAFER STREETS, YEAH, WILL REQUIRE A LOT OF BRIDGE BUILDING. THAT'S FOR SURE. WE'VE GOT A FEW WEEKS LEFT BEFORE THE MAYOR PERHAPS CHOOSES. >> LOURDES DUARTE: HIS NEXT SUPERINTENDENT, WHAT CAN PEOPLE WHO MAY BE WATCHING AT HOME DO IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS IF A WANT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR OPINIONS ON WHO THE NEXT SHOULD BE TO BE HEARD. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST? I DO. >> WELL, I THINK THIS IS A THAT IS REALLY UP TO THE MAYOR'S TO COMMUNICATING WITH THEM COMMUNICATING, EVEN PERHAPS WITH ALL THE MONEY IS PROBABLY THE MOST NEEDY IN WAY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT FINAL DECISION-MAKING. I REALLY HOPE PEOPLE OF CHICAGO KNOW THAT THESE PUBLIC SAFETY APPARATUS THAT WE BUILD REALLY ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO BE PARTICIPANTS, NOT JUST THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SELECTING THE SUPERINTENDENT, BUT FOR FUTURE BIG QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE LINED UP MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT POLICY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, THAT I AM A PART OF THE COMMUNITY COMMISSION. ACTUALLY WANTS TO HEAR FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROCESS US REVEALING AND DRAFTING POLICIES. WE KNOW TOO, THAT WE CAN DO ALL OF F THIS EFFORT ON ROOM. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE WAYS IN WHICH WE ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THEM IS ACTUALLY HAVING PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THESE DISTRICT COUNCILS AND POLICE DEPARTMENT, EVERY POLICE DISTRICT. I'M SORRY, HAS ELECTED NOW 3 DISTRICT COUNCILS THAT ARE GOING TO BE KEY IN BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS FURTHERING THE WORK OF THE POLICE AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY APPARATUS THAT WE HAVE. THE COMMUNITY COMMISSION THEM PART OF ALSO WANT TO HEAR YOUR INPUT AND WE EVEN HAVE SOMEBODY HELP US UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES FACING THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THEM IS A NON CITIZEN ADVISORY COUNCIL. AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW PEOPLE THAT CAN BRING IN THAT PERSPECTIVE ARE NEWCOMER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. SO IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT, YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION IN OUR WEB SITE. THE COMMUNITY COMMISSION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE HOPE THAT THE COMMUNITY WILL GET BEHIND THIS EFFORT SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE PARTICIPANTS IN MAKING OUR CITY A BETTER, SAFER PLACE. ALL RIGHT. AND THIS IDEA OF HAVING THE COMMUNITY HELP PICK THE SUPERINTENDENT IS SORT OF ONE PIECE. >> AND WHAT WILL BE A LARGER PROJECT TO COME HERE IN THE COMING MONTHS. AND OF COURSE, YEARS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I DO."

July of 2023 has been the hottest on Earth in recorded human history that's according to scientists at the world of meteorological organization and the eu's Copernicus climate change service in a press conference yesterday United Nations the United Nations Chief says that the Earth is at a major changing point all this is entirely consistent with predictions and repeated warnings the only surprise is the speed of the change climate change is here it is terrifying and it is just the beginning the idea of global warming has ended the area the era of global boiling has arrived from global warning to Global boiling joining us now is journalist Jeff Goodell and writer of the new book The Heat will kill you first Jeff thanks for being with us to talk about this very heavy topic happy to be here well you know a lot of folks for a lot of folks this is hard to confront I mean I still you know divisive lines but as we continue to live through these extreme conditions it's hard to argue the world the climate the planet's changing in your book you actually talk about this chain saying that we have left the quote Goldilocks zone what do you mean by that well the Goldilocks zone is a phrase that scientists use who are looking for life on other planets um they're looking for the presence of liquid water that's a good sign that it might be life if it's too cold the water is ice if it's too hot it's been vaporized and it's not there so they call this sort of life-giving Zone the Goldilocks zone and I use that in my book to talk about how you know all life on this planet including us of course but but everything else around us grew up in this sort of stable climate range that we're very good at dealing with but as our climate heats up we're moving out of that range and it's becoming more and more difficult for humans to handle that kind of extreme temperatures that we're now moving into and that's the key word extreme it's high highs and low lows and they're just drastic and coming at times that we don't expect this type of weather or weather phenomenon to happen many scientists have been warning about climate change for years but as we heard the head of the United Nations say they're surprised that the speed that it's all happening are you shocked by this as well yes and no I mean uh this the warming has been predicted by climate scientists for a very long time and what we're seeing now is within the range of that kind of warming that they've been talking about but it's very difficult to predict you know uh immediate events you know near-term events extreme events where these kinds of heat waves will pop up how long exactly they will last those kinds of things you know weather is a very chaotic system and so in the in the immediate sense um there's I think I'm surprised in a lot of others that like I'm here in Texas it's been extremely hot here for a couple of weeks and the sort of length and duration of these of these heat waves I think is catching Everybody by surprise and given the mounting empirical evidence that's right in front of us how do you explain how there are still naysayers about climate change well there's a lot of reasons why people you know are skeptical about climate change and going from you know uh their financial interests some people are invested in various Industries oil and gas most primary among them that you know are do not stand to benefit from a world that takes climate change seriously to ideological reasons you know one of the things that's really happened in the you know I've been writing about climate change for 20 years and one of the things that's really shifted is it used to be an economic argument it used to be oh you know moving to renewable energy is too expensive when you can't afford the subsidies we can't afford to build solar and wind and things like that that's been reversed now solar and wind and Renewables are by far the cheapest way to create energy but the climates you know debate now has shifted into the sort of culture wars that we see in America between the left and the right you know this idea of woke culture and you know there's been a real attempt to undermine you know science itself we saw that during covid and it's happening again certainly become political will scientists say it's evident that humans contributed to this climate change where to blame came to a degree so if that's the case if mankind caused it how can we reverse it well we're not going to reverse it we're not going to go back to the climate that you and I and everybody who's watching this grew up in we're moving into a new climate realm no matter what we do but we can have a lot of impact on how bad it gets and the primary thing to do is to eliminate as fast as possible uh the burning of fossil fuels to recognize that we're in a kind of climate emergency that these extreme events are going to get worse and worse until we get serious about eliminating fossil fuels and then we need to adapt our cities and and places where we live to these extreme events you know getting air conditioning more accessible to more people more green spaces and cities more access to sort of public Cooling and most of all getting smart about the risks of extreme heat which I think are widely underestimated those are some great tips and advice for people who may feel hopeless about climate change about little small incremental things they could do to help the environment help Stave off things as they continue to deteriorate great Jeff Goodell who just wrote the new book The Heat will kill you and across the country a lot of folks can feel like that's a very true statement certainly not as Extreme as the we've been seeing out in the West in some areas but today with the heat index in Chicago 105 to 115 degrees that's pretty hot Jeff kiddo thanks for being with us thank you for having me

impacting much of the country tonight Mills Hayes joins us with the latest on the struggle to stay cool live from Minnesota Mills hey Don and Corey well here in on Old Lane Lake Minnetonka it is feeling Breezy that wind is definitely a savior right now but overall the air is pretty muggy and heavy lots of people taking advantage of the water today I'm seeing a ton of sailboats out on the water here and in the Minneapolis metro area we haven't quite hit 100 degrees yet we thought we might get there today hasn't quite happened however it feels like it's about 100 degrees and so far the National Weather Service says that we are seeing a much hotter summer than usual in June temperatures were about five degrees above average and across the country we're really seeing this heat impact people more than half of Americans are at risk because of this heat that can be dangerous at times people here in the Minneapolis metro area say that they're just trying to stay in the shade and near water President Biden said today that there's no denying the impact of Clan climate change now the United Nations Secretary General went even further calling it an era of global boiling across the country Americans are sweating in Phoenix it's been over 110 degrees for nearly a month there have been reports of people getting third degree burns from falling on the pavement and in South Florida the ocean water feels like a hot tub back here in Minnesota the National Weather Service says that the dew points in the metro area are usually in the 60s but they are in the 70s now that means that it feels tropical and muggier than usual when you're outside I can attest to that and keep in mind Minnesota had a long and colder winter than usual so some folks here are just welcoming the warmer weather now we're just running through the sprinklers because it is so hot um feels a little bit oily but sun and humid I just keep sweating I step outside immediately I'm dripping we were complaining about the Colts and now we can't complain about this this is she lives for this but I'm ready to go inside and President Biden announced steps today to tackle this heat he says he's directing the Department of Labor to ramp up inspections a potentially dangerous work sites like construction sites he also says he's going to be giving about a billion dollars in Grants towards local communities so that they can plant trees and help make it a little bit shadier in the in their areas in Minneapolis Mills Hayes Fox 32 Chicago thank you Mills Global boiling that's interesting I hadn't heard that one is that a highly scientific term very yeah I like it a lot I haven't heard that one I'm here for it okay so today it's very hot outside we have temperatures here at home that are sitting in the lower 90s 91 degrees at O'Hare same thing at Midway 93 degrees now in Joliet but again those dew point temperatures there in the 70s so it's actually feeling like the upper 90s and low 100s out there this evening the rest of your evening hours we stay quiet we do have a chance of storms starting around 2 A.M until about 6 or 7 A.M so I'm starting the clock here on futurecast tomorrow morning at 6 a.m spotty showers still going to be around but I think any strong severe storms are out of here by this point then we're drying things out and really heating things up so tomorrow I really think tomorrow is going to be the hottest day that we've seen all week we're counting on actual air temperatures in the mid 90s so your heat index value is likely in the triple digits almost everywhere tomorrow afternoon very very hot so we're going to have a lot of heat a lot of instability to work with as our cold front begins to approach so then Friday evening if you have Friday evening plans have ways to get severe weather alerts notice by 7 or 8 PM we're starting to see this strong line of showers and storms moving through approaching Chicago closer to 10 p.m and then just kind of plowing into Northwest Indiana by 11 p.m finally that severe threat I think that's going to be ending closer to midnight or 1 a.m but heavy downpours damaging wind gusts hail and possibly even a few isolated tornadoes going to be possible again that is for Friday evening roughly from 7 P.M through about midnight for tonight 76 degrees for your overnight low so not much relief from the heat 94 degrees tomorrow and then finally there you see it the cooler air it's building in for the weekend low 80s Saturday and Sunday but we're back up to near 90 by Wednesday and Thursday of next week back to you

woes but there might be another whole chapter on this Saga after a judge pulled a rare move melon Rivera has the latest from Washington it was a three-hour drama-filled court appearance Wednesday for the president's son and it ended unexpectedly it was supposed to be an open and shut case when Hunter Biden showed up to a federal hearing Wednesday to resolve tax and gun charges but a plea deal that Hunter's lawyers brokered with the prosecution was rejected by a judge and without a deal hunter had to plead not guilty to charges he was going to admit to very telling that the judge intervened here and said basically no I'm not going to approve some sweeping blanket deal judge Mariella Noriega questioned the scope of the plea deal and was worried it would preclude further prosecutions against the president's son how could they not have reached an agreement on whether or not he could be prosecuted on other charges the fact that there was just not a meeting of the minds that there was some massive Communication Breakdown between the two sides the lead prosecutor on the case confirmed investigations are still ongoing the president the first lady they love their son and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life Republicans are celebrating because they said the original plea deal let Hunter Biden off too easy especially after two IRS whistleblowers testify that the Department of Justice interfered in the probe and gave the president's son preferential treatment Hunter Biden if you are watching this right now you are not above the law and Justice is coming for you today Hunter Biden had no family with him in the courtroom Wednesday he did have one friend with him who helped him pay off those overdue taxes in Washington matler of era Fox 32 Chicago and now for some clarification on what happened in court today we want to bring in Stephen Caliendo professor of political science at North Central College yeah thanks for joining us Professor let's get right into this to Madeleine Rivera's point this was ostensibly a routine court appearance Hunter Biden set to plead guilty right now everything's at a standstill what happened what a wild ride we had today that's for sure this should have been maybe 30 45 minutes at the most uh but the judge you know a plea deal has to be approved by the judge and so it just because both sides came to what they thought was an agreement didn't mean it was going to go through when the judge started asking specific questions I think both sides at that point came to understand that they didn't have a good understanding uh that is that they they had different interpretations of what this deal was going to mean and so the judge did her job uh and and sussing that out and that really is going to save a lot of problems down the road it could have saved a lot of problems down the road uh if there was a misunderstanding okay so just yesterday House Republicans filed a brief asking that judge to throw out the plea deal after hearing testimony from an IRS whistleblower who said that Hunter received preferential treatment so do you think the judge was pressured by that brief look I don't know if it was that brief certainly there's just a lot of media attention surrounding this particular case um it's an odd case in a lot of ways it's an odd case because the president's son's involved it's also an odd case because typically when people pay their taxes late they don't face uh significant charges to them but um this is complicated in a number of ways so I'm sure she had a lot on her mind um but I don't think it was the question of interference that led to this rejection of the deal it was um when she asked the questions both sides came to understand that they had different interpretations of what was happening with that she had a responsibility then to say I got to put a kibosh on this and so they took a break the two sides talked somewhere they came up to something else she still wasn't satisfied that it was clear enough and so she gave them each 30 days to come back so that they should make another decision yeah I'm glad you brought up the 30 days because I was a little confused by Hunter Biden's decision to change his plea I was under the assumption this was going to be just a delay but now he's pled not guilty what does that mean for the case going forward well it doesn't mean anything he can change his plea to guilty later on if there's a deal that's reached but he certainly wasn't going to plead guilty today without a deal in place right you have to say not guilty and then you know imagine that you're moving forward as if there's going to be a trial I don't know whether there'll be a trial or not I don't think anybody knows that at this point they're going to try to reach another deal but certainly we couldn't expect Hunter Biden to plead guilty if he didn't know that what the terms of that plea would be and we got to bring this point up as well both the judge and the prosecutor in this case are Trump appointees from what you've seen have they acted partisan in any way no they haven't from what I've seen I think that again I can see I can imagine people on the left being frustrated by this because it felt like it was a done deal but the judge didn't come in with guns blazing uh she was asking questions for clarity and and and they were good questions and it became clear very very quickly um within the first few minutes that this wasn't uh this wasn't going the way either so I thought it was going to go unfortunately we got to end it there I really wanted to ask you about uh Trump and the so-called trial of the century but we're out of time Stephen Caliendo always a pleasure to talk to you sir it was good to see you both I'll be back if you need me all right thanks

Nation to look with open eyes at that horror and to act the story of Emmett Till and the incredible bravery of Mamie till Mobley helped fuel the movement for civil rights in America and their stories continue to inspire our Collective fight for justice when I served in the United States Senate I was so profoundly honored to sponsor the Emmett Till anti-lynching act alongside Congressman Bobby Rush and it was an even greater honor to stand beside our President Joe Biden as he signed the law that finally made lynching a federal crime so many leaders here today made that progress possible our history as a nation is born of tragedy and Triumph of struggle and success that is Who We Are and as people who love our country as Patriots we know that we must remember and teach our full history even when it is painful especially when it is painful today there are those in our nation who would prefer to erase or even rewrite the ugly parts of our past those who attempt to teach that enslaved people benefited from slavery those who insult us in an attempt to Gaslight us who try to divide our nation with unnecessary debates let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget we will be better if we remember we will be stronger if we remember because we all here know it is only by understanding and learning from our past that we can continue to work together to build a better future and so now it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has dedicated his life to preserving and protecting our history and Reverend wheeler Parker Jr just also shared with

of certain death in the darkness of a thousand midnights in a pitch black house on what Psalm have called Bach fearow back then in the darkness I could never imagine A Moment Like This standing in the

have been like it's hard to believe I was 12 years old and I just you know I know no matter how much time has passed how many birthdays how many events how many anniversaries it's hard to relive this brings it all back we're talking about rev as if it happened yesterday the images in your head and things you remember but it's inspiring to see how many of your family have continued as mothers courage to find faith and pain purpose and pain that's a that's a remarkable thing it seems to me insisting on an open Castle a casket for her murdered and I might add maimed and mutilated Sun 14 years old she said let the people see what I've seen let the people see what I have seen my God all of us have lost children in other ways how hard it is even to close the casket or keep it open or did what a debate it is but see the child that had been maimed in a country and the world saw and I just heard the story of Emmett Till and his mother as a story of a family's promise and loss in the Nations Reckoning with hate violence racism overwhelming abuse of power and brutality it's hard to fathom hard to find them this even a war for me it's hard to fathom but today on what we've been we would have been Emmett's 82nd birthday we had another chapter in a story of remembrance and healing just as we joined together when I signed the law in his name to make lynching a federal crime and think how long that took that to happen I mean and we screened the movie till at the White House today we joined together as I sign a proclamation designating Emmett Till and maybe till Mobley National monument in both Illinois and Mississippi [Applause] when we ended lynching as a matter of law we talked about wanting to do this but the support from the community it's been so overwhelming I thank the members of Congress for their support and more than that their leadership at a time when there are those who seek to ban books Barry history we're making it clear crystal clear all darkness and denialism can hide much they erase nothing you can hide but they erase nothing we can't just choose to learn what we want to know we have to learn what we should know about our country we should know everything the good the bad the truth of who we are as a nation that's what great Nations do and we are a great nation that's what they do for only with truth comes healing Justice repair and another step forward toward forming a more perfect union we've got a hell of a long way to go that's what's happening that's what's going to happen with visitors of all backgrounds to learn the history of Emmett Till maybe till Mobley through our National Monument look telling the truth and the full history of our nation is important it's important our children our grandchildren our great-grandchildren to our nation as a whole I've said it before the lesson I learned of coming out of not like real leaders in the Civil Rights move but I came out of the Civil Rights Movement as a kid the public defender and I used to uh you know I used to say think that you passed something that was good you can make hate go away hate never goes away it just hides it hides under the rocks and given a little bit of oxygen by bad people it comes roaring out again it's up to all of us to deal with that up to all of us to stop it up to all of us the best way to do this with the truth it's using a different context but I think it applies here silence is complicity I will not be silent nor will you be silent about what happened it was really critical work ahead to continue the fight for racial Justice and equality for all Americans and my Administration is committed to Leading a path forward and I know the members of Congress here are even more committed than that I'm going to close this the reason the world saw what Mrs till Mowgli saw was because another hero in this story the black press oh I'm serious Jet Magazine a Chicago defender in other newspapers and radio announcers who told the story for unflinching The Bravery which which they told that story making sure America saw saw what they saw Ida B Wells once said quote the way to right wrongs to turn the light of Truth upon them the way to right wrongs To Shine the Light Of Truth on them well that's our charge today by the apparent things you ever think we'd be talking about banning books in America banned in history I'm serious the chill family to all of you here today I thank you for your courage for never giving up never never given up before I say even what's more is on my mind I'm not going to leave this podium oh I mean it's just barbaric what happened seriously all you moms out there imagine the courage it took to say let them see courage it's now my honor to sign this proclamation in memory of Emmett Till and Miss Mamie till Mobley and I thank you all for being here and I am I know I'm considered too much of an optimist but I believe if we keep pushing we're going to continue to make progress that's already being made the idea that when that 14 year old was buried than this Indian treaty room of this many people of color holding powerful office changing the direction of the country would have been beyond our comprehension [Applause] thank you okay you ready keep our commission on signing establishes the Emmett Till Maybe till Mobley National Monument [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music]

0nafbldP,The Chicago Vibe,This old news,Finalists for Chicago Police Superintendent Position Announced ; Mayor to Decide,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nafbldP,Community Commission Sends Mayor Johnson Three Candidates for CPD Superintendent,Commissioners Anthony Driver and Remel Terry join WGN-TV Political Report to talk about the search for a new police superintendent.,"Mayor Brandon Johnson now on the clock with a little less than a month to pick a new superintendent for the Chicago Police Department. For the first time, the city's new community Commission on Public Safety and Accountability led the search narrowing down 54 candidates to just three. The finalists are Madison, Wisconsin's chief of police, Shawn Barnes, who once worked for Copa. CPD veteran Chief Angel Novelas, who heads the department's policy and training reforms strategy, and CPD's chief of counterterrorism, Larry Snelling. Joining me this morning to talk more about the first of its kind process is the commission's president, Anthony Driver, and Commissioner Rommel Terry. Good morning to you both. Thanks for joining me. Glad to be here. Thank you for having me. So let me start with you. Many people believe in order to heal the relationship between the community, city hall, law enforcement, that the selection coming from inside the departing, it would be pretty critical now. Two of your three meet that criteria. But what was the tone of the committee on that issue? Yeah, I think we did our best to be objective. When you when you look at all of our candidates, everyone who's applied, we want to make sure that we pick the best of the best. As I've said many times before, you can't be Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant or whatever great athlete that you would like to be if you only said get your teammates right. You have to compete against people from across the country, from around the world. And that's what happened in this process. And we believe we found the best of the best. One of the things, Rimmel, that was new about this, this process really for the first time was community driven. Talk about the importance of that element. And what I mean by that is the importance compared to the need to be sure that the right person with the proper law enforcement skills, a technical piece, how those two got balanced. Well, as we know, the role of the superintendent is to be the superintendent for all of Chicago. So it was very important to ensure that community voices were at the forefront of this process. And when we say community, we also mean police officers. This is the first time their voices have been heard as well in what they would like to see in a superintendent. So we made sure that everyone who will be impacted by this role was heard. So, Anthony, I've gone through who the three selections are. They're all men. They are all persons of color. Can you talk about the factors that led to these three being the ultimate and final selections? Yeah. Well, first it was their written application, their written materials that were submitted that we review. It's their educational history is their background, is their proven track record. It's our ability to look back in their past and see what they've been able to do and what they've been able to accomplish within police organizations. And is it also speak to their vision, their ability to sift through, you know, five, 6 hours worth of interviews with our commission and and ask the questions that were taken from the community, from subject matter experts, from folks around the country with law enforcement experience. It really knocked those questions out of the park. I know what they know about these three. Thank you. Okay. I know one thing important to you guys, of course, was having this be a very transparent process. You had some pushback, although I will say that the Police Federation president, John Katon Zahra, he seemed to be pleased with the community involvement here. But of course, you had back in June 19 aldermen, older people who, you know, wanted certain demands and requirements. They wanted you all to grant an interview to CPD Chief of Patrol Brian McDermott. That didn't happen. How did you all deal with the political pressures, Rommel, that were put upon you? Clearly, I'm sure, by a variety of factors. Well, the way that we dealt with political pressure is by maintaining our independence. This is an independent commission, and we have shown time and time again through all of the work that we've done thus far, and especially during the superintendent process, that we will not be into any political will because this is about the community and us choosing the best candidate and not about anyone who has certain relationships but who rose to the top as president. Driver has already pointed out as the best of the best. On Thursday night, you, the community, got to speak out on all of this. I'm sort of curious, Anthony, on that. How much did the voices of the community truly you did your thing as a committee, as a commission, How much did you really take into account the voice of the people when they would speak at a public meeting? We had a tremendous impact on us. As I said last night, this was not public engagemement for the sake of checking the box. This is public engagement for the sake of checking in with the community. So we released a 68 page report. In that report, community members to access questions can actually go and look and see the questions. They us were used in the superintendent search process. We took those questions and asked them directly to people who were applying for this job. So we also use that to develop our scoring material. Everything was taken from the community, from experts from around the country. Remember, the mayor now has 30 days. I mean, that that's the rule, right? He's on the clock already to decide from when the decision was announced to decide whether he is going to go with one of these three candidates. He also has the power to say, nope, don't want any of them. Let's have another national search and go through a similar process again. Romel, how important is it, do you think, to the committee, to your group, to you, that the mayor select from among these three, or is your vision of this sort of, Oh, we tried, but if he doesn't like them, well, then he can do what? Yes, we respect the authority of the mayor and his autonomy to make the decision that he chooses. But what we do believe is that we've put forth some of the best candidates from our nationwide search. So we're pretty confident that Mayor Johnston will be pleased with the work that we've done. He's already giving us accolades for the work and he's respected our process. And I believe that we put forth some of the best of the best. And he has an opportunity to choose someone if he chooses. Anthony, just a final question. Former long time inspector General Joe Ferguson said, look, the challenges are beyond the capacity of any one person. Was part of your consideration thinking about the other players in this Cook County state's attorney, the other various people that play a role? Yeah, and we interviewed those folks and we talked to every single one of them during this process. On our subject matter, expert list that we are that we interview. So of course, but as I've always said, we're here to run our leg of race. That new superintendent has to run their race and they're addressing that to run here. And so does everybody else. We're not trying to fix everything in this problem. We just want to be a part of the solution. All right. Anthony Driver and Terry, thank you for your insight on this recent process. We're going to watch it carefully and I'm sure we'll talk to you again. Thank you so much. Have a good Sunday. Thank you. All right. We're going to take one more break. We'll be right back."

[Music] welcome back to The nightcap we were talking about the buchona lifestyle but I'm behind the bar now because I have to know how to make this delicious Paloma a pink flamingo and my fellas are here to do what all right so the pink flamingo is the Paloma of insolito yes yeah it's our ref on the classic Paloma and it is the perfect drink for the which one s lifestyle it is something anybody can make at home so we got you lined up with every ingredient you'll need four-step cocktail super super easy and we're using only the best tequila or additive free so that's one thing that'll make your ingredients really really pop so we got fresh lime juice agave nectar fresh grapefruit and then just a pinch of Himalayan sea salt do you think you can handle that just yeah all right Tyler you are the territorial yes manager yes I managed the business here in Houston so all our on-premise business off-premise business that'll be hotels restaurants bars anywhere you see in Toledo in Houston you were a part of it that's Tyler Austin Treadwell and Christopher you are the brand ambassador so what does this brand represent represents quality um I talk to a lot of people about how it's a matter of free tequila and that off the rift just tells people like it's it's quality over anything so we really pride ourselves on quality and behind that it's how we capture the essence of the brand as well so I really play a big role in that too just you know being able to be behind the camera and getting content for the company so quality meeting you know extra like oomph on the The Branding just like for me it's a passion of mine so oh yeah I mean it's a beautiful look yeah as you all can see I've been stalling making this because I'm not always the best bartender but here we go I promise all right walk me through it Tyler what do I got using our Reposado tequila which is an age tequila we age it for six to ten months in New American Oak so with this you're gonna add two ounces we've got ice in the Shaker already yes see I'm so happy you ran into the Shakers so the tequila being aged that way and new American Oak is going to give you some really nice notes you get vanilla you get some nuttiness you get almond you're also going to get some baking spices like cinnamon so with that fresh lime juice you're gonna add next just one ounce okay I'm sorry half an ounce there then you're gonna add one ounce of your grapefruit juice okay so one two three half an ounce of agave so that'll just sweeten it up a little bit and all these flavors are gonna marry together so I'm gonna hand you this here and I know you got a good shake so I'm gonna keep this on here tight so give us your best and hold on for it there you go I know what I'm doing it's nice and cold yeah my hand's stuck to it now okay pour it over ice technical difficulties so you just pour this over ice and what we're doing what makes a pink flamingo special with insolito which just means rare uncommon extraordinary is that we're not only using all fresh ingredients added to free tequila we're gonna also top it off with a little bit of Fever Tree pink grapefruit so this is going to give it a nice little effervescence and then just a pinch of sea salt add a little salinity there so one two three four five and then I love how your account was literally everything you know what you're doing yes baby that's all it is I mean I already know yeah see see how you did is this worthy cheers this is the only thing of which one I should be drinking to be honest with you if she's not drinking that she needs to have her man get the top shelf this is aneja so this is aged even longer so this is going to be 18 to 24 months and new American Oak barrels and then that is our top shelf in salido and if

0nduJjj9,The Houston Vibe,no alert. weather Channel is going bananas because there has no storms impacting the us. there will have to be alot of storms for them to be close to their predicted number.,Alert for Possible Emergence of Tropical Storm 'Em ily ' in the Atlantic,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nduJjj9,"Tropical Weather Forecast - July 26, 2023","The tropical wave near the Bahamas and the other wave in the eastern Caribbean ran into some unfavorable conditions and are no longer being monitored for development. However, a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic is not expected to develop over the next two days. But this wave has a 30% chance to become a tropical depression, storm or hurricane over the next week as it moves west. Saharan dust in the Atlantic is limiting development. But outside of the dust, water temperatures are very warm and that will act as fuel for future systems.",happy Wednesday to you on Fox 26 meteorologist ramisha shade it's that time of the afternoon when you get an update on what is happening what's cooking out there in the tropics now yesterday we had not one not two but three tropical waves that we were tracking but it did appear that they were moving and kind of kind of an unfavorable environment for development at least the two that were already there we did have this one pop up yesterday but we also had one in the Eastern Caribbean and one that was starting to push closer to the Bahamas so both of those have kind of fizzled out faded away because they ran into basically a lot of wind shear that Saharan dust and they didn't survive so now we're left with this last tropical wave for now this is the one that is still very close to the west coast of Africa it is moving to the West Northwest and actually over the next 48 hours that Saharan dust out there will likely limit any development so the chance for development over the next two days at zero percent so we're really not concerned about it doing much of anything over the next couple of days you can see that area there kind of blowing up showing the Reds and the yellows there that's the disorganized area of showers and storms associated with this tropical wave not much to look at now but as it slowly pushes across the Atlantic into the central Atlantic and especially as it gets into the Western Atlantic we are expecting this to be the area where there could be some potential development so over the next week as this wave gets into this area and there's a 30 percent chance that it could blow up and start to develop into a more well-defined system and maybe turn into a tropical depression tropical storm or potentially a hurricane the next name on the list would be Emily so we will be watching that tropical wave closely here's the remnants of what was a tropical wave yesterday still bringing some heavy rain to portions of Puerto Rico and portions of the leeward Island funds the other tropical wave that we had yesterday off around the Bahamas area that one is already starting to push some showers and storms into portions of Central and Southern Florida but it is not expected to strengthen into a tropical Cyclone it's the good news there elsewhere in the Caribbean in the Gulf of Mexico all is quiet we are not tracking any additional systems right now so things will remain quiet for Houston and for all of Southeast Texas let's hop over to the Eastern Pacific and we have another system trying to get going here this one has the potential to develop into an area of low pressure over the next couple of days but the chance very very low may be developing into a tropical system by the next week over the next seven days there's a 20 percent shot and you can see the area of development off to the south and west of Acapulco and south of Mexico City so we'll watch this system in the Eastern Pacific this one would likely push Northwest so it would not be an impact for us but of course we will continue to keep you updated on what's Happening Now back to the Saharan dust we've been tracking this over the recent weeks and you can see that brown rolling off of the west coast of Africa so we've still got quite a bit of Saharan dust across much of the Atlantic you see we kind of get a break in that dustiness as you get closer to the Lesser Antilles that is the area where that tropical wave could gradually start to get stronger the one in the Eastern Atlantic at this point so that's what we're going to watch over the next week a lot of dust as well in the Gulf of Mexico some of that dust has reached the Houston area so we are experiencing those hazy Dusty Skies out there but that dust actually bringing in some drier air and that will help to limit any chance for any tropical systems heading our way but once we start to get rid of some of that dust we have very warm Waters out there in the Atlantic Caribbean and the gulf in fact water temps across much of the Atlantic are still four to six degrees above normal and that will likely continue for the next couple of weeks you can see those sea surface temps for the Atlantic for much of it at least in the 80s even a 90 degree temperature reading very close to the southern coast of Florida so certainly some very warm Waters out there same deal for the Caribbean for the gulf temperatures well into the 80s so once we get rid of that Saharan dust we're likely going to have some rapid development so we are monitoring that one tropical wave in the Eastern Atlantic the next name on the list as I mentioned would be Emily so we could have tropical storm Emily hurricane Emily over the next week it's a low chance but it is definitely a chance after that we'd have Franklin Gert and then Harold so we've still got a long way to go in our hurricane season we're coming to the end of of July but we've still got August and the usually busiest time of hurricane season which would be September the peak being September 10th so we'll be watching it closely as we go through the next couple of months especially we've got all the way through the end of November when we can have these systems to develop and we'll be here to keep you updated day by day every afternoon usually between about 4 and 4 30 you can get these updates on what's happening out in the Tropics of course if you haven't already we tell you this every day but we really want you to download that Fox 26 weather app you can have that on your phone so you'll be updated with tropical alerts if we get any with any local severe weather alerts heat alerts whatever is going on you can find it out on our Fox 26 weather app we've got all sorts of tropical features on there weather updates of course from your Fox 26 weather team and you can track whatever is happening on our local radar as well I'm Fox 26 meteorologist ramisha Shane enjoy the rest of your day

0nduJjj9,The Houston Vibe,Um spelling?,Alert for Possible Emergence of Tropical Storm 'Em ily ' in the Atlantic,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nduJjj9,"Tropical Weather Forecast - July 26, 2023","The tropical wave near the Bahamas and the other wave in the eastern Caribbean ran into some unfavorable conditions and are no longer being monitored for development. However, a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic is not expected to develop over the next two days. But this wave has a 30% chance to become a tropical depression, storm or hurricane over the next week as it moves west. Saharan dust in the Atlantic is limiting development. But outside of the dust, water temperatures are very warm and that will act as fuel for future systems.",happy Wednesday to you on Fox 26 meteorologist ramisha shade it's that time of the afternoon when you get an update on what is happening what's cooking out there in the tropics now yesterday we had not one not two but three tropical waves that we were tracking but it did appear that they were moving and kind of kind of an unfavorable environment for development at least the two that were already there we did have this one pop up yesterday but we also had one in the Eastern Caribbean and one that was starting to push closer to the Bahamas so both of those have kind of fizzled out faded away because they ran into basically a lot of wind shear that Saharan dust and they didn't survive so now we're left with this last tropical wave for now this is the one that is still very close to the west coast of Africa it is moving to the West Northwest and actually over the next 48 hours that Saharan dust out there will likely limit any development so the chance for development over the next two days at zero percent so we're really not concerned about it doing much of anything over the next couple of days you can see that area there kind of blowing up showing the Reds and the yellows there that's the disorganized area of showers and storms associated with this tropical wave not much to look at now but as it slowly pushes across the Atlantic into the central Atlantic and especially as it gets into the Western Atlantic we are expecting this to be the area where there could be some potential development so over the next week as this wave gets into this area and there's a 30 percent chance that it could blow up and start to develop into a more well-defined system and maybe turn into a tropical depression tropical storm or potentially a hurricane the next name on the list would be Emily so we will be watching that tropical wave closely here's the remnants of what was a tropical wave yesterday still bringing some heavy rain to portions of Puerto Rico and portions of the leeward Island funds the other tropical wave that we had yesterday off around the Bahamas area that one is already starting to push some showers and storms into portions of Central and Southern Florida but it is not expected to strengthen into a tropical Cyclone it's the good news there elsewhere in the Caribbean in the Gulf of Mexico all is quiet we are not tracking any additional systems right now so things will remain quiet for Houston and for all of Southeast Texas let's hop over to the Eastern Pacific and we have another system trying to get going here this one has the potential to develop into an area of low pressure over the next couple of days but the chance very very low may be developing into a tropical system by the next week over the next seven days there's a 20 percent shot and you can see the area of development off to the south and west of Acapulco and south of Mexico City so we'll watch this system in the Eastern Pacific this one would likely push Northwest so it would not be an impact for us but of course we will continue to keep you updated on what's Happening Now back to the Saharan dust we've been tracking this over the recent weeks and you can see that brown rolling off of the west coast of Africa so we've still got quite a bit of Saharan dust across much of the Atlantic you see we kind of get a break in that dustiness as you get closer to the Lesser Antilles that is the area where that tropical wave could gradually start to get stronger the one in the Eastern Atlantic at this point so that's what we're going to watch over the next week a lot of dust as well in the Gulf of Mexico some of that dust has reached the Houston area so we are experiencing those hazy Dusty Skies out there but that dust actually bringing in some drier air and that will help to limit any chance for any tropical systems heading our way but once we start to get rid of some of that dust we have very warm Waters out there in the Atlantic Caribbean and the gulf in fact water temps across much of the Atlantic are still four to six degrees above normal and that will likely continue for the next couple of weeks you can see those sea surface temps for the Atlantic for much of it at least in the 80s even a 90 degree temperature reading very close to the southern coast of Florida so certainly some very warm Waters out there same deal for the Caribbean for the gulf temperatures well into the 80s so once we get rid of that Saharan dust we're likely going to have some rapid development so we are monitoring that one tropical wave in the Eastern Atlantic the next name on the list as I mentioned would be Emily so we could have tropical storm Emily hurricane Emily over the next week it's a low chance but it is definitely a chance after that we'd have Franklin Gert and then Harold so we've still got a long way to go in our hurricane season we're coming to the end of of July but we've still got August and the usually busiest time of hurricane season which would be September the peak being September 10th so we'll be watching it closely as we go through the next couple of months especially we've got all the way through the end of November when we can have these systems to develop and we'll be here to keep you updated day by day every afternoon usually between about 4 and 4 30 you can get these updates on what's happening out in the Tropics of course if you haven't already we tell you this every day but we really want you to download that Fox 26 weather app you can have that on your phone so you'll be updated with tropical alerts if we get any with any local severe weather alerts heat alerts whatever is going on you can

FOX 26's Damali Keith has more on why she's being held.",foreign thony Antoine and this is Fox 26 Crime Files we start with the horrific details of an 18 year old who investigators say was held captive in a house in Humble as Fox 26's Dominique Keith reports law enforcement says she lived in a house of torture for at least a month deputies did observe marks on her hands and legs which would indicate restraints before help arrived here on foxmont Lane late Sunday investigators say 31-year-old Jose Reyes and 29 year old Jacqueline Macias were holding and torturing an 18 year old girl here at this house in Humble after they basically started holding her against her will they began sexually assaulting her and other things and just a very uh evil evil thing precinct for a constable Mark Herman says the 18 year old victim met Jose Reyes and says Reyes coax the girl here to his house where 29 year old Macias was waiting the whole script flipped like almost immediately and she was immediately held captive tied up and held in a room for approximately 30 days we don't know the exact amount of days but close to 30 days or maybe a little even more than that around 10 P.M Sunday the 18 year old escaped and even with her arms still bound she was running to neighboring homes for help the lady is stand up over there by the window she told me I don't see what size they didn't leave her for long because they were back probably within 10 minutes it's very scary because you know my daughter 18 wants to go out do stuff with her friends and I'm the one to tell her you know everything that's out there because you know just it's getting crazy investigators say Reyes and Macias were arrested as soon as they returned to the house and Constable Herman says the 18 year old knew when they left and that's when she worked to get out of some of her restraints and she was able to somehow escape and get to neighbors and that's when the neighbors called 9-1-1 now Reyes and massias are charged with kidnapping more charges are expected in Humble I'm Dominique Heath Fox 26 news and the very next day the accused kidnappers were in court and domini was there the state is going to uh has an obligation to give us any evidence they may have any statements from the complainant witness so that we could prepare the case and the defense that evidence Discovery phase is the next legal step for Jose Reyes and Jacqueline Macias when the two appeared here separately in court this hearing was an initial arraignment my client and the co-defendant which is his wife they have a two week year old kid who's currently right now in NICU due to the child being born early so Messias was giving birth just two weeks ago the 18 year old girl says she's been captive here in this Humble Home being terrorized raped and restrained for the last 30 days after she says she was lured here by Reyes Precinct Force has a chain and several padlocks were found in a bedroom in the house but it was not a stranger on Stranger type relationship the actual relationship those two individuals knew one another very well because my client has no prior Criminal record of course she's pursuant innocent and uh she would probably post bond and go home bond for Macias has been set at fifty thousand dollars Reyes is being held on a 95 000 Bond why is his higher because of the allegations that my client was the one that had the relationship with the complainant um there were also some allegations that he may have engaged in some type of sexual contact with the complainant uh while she was allegedly in custody with uh within his home well it's something we see all the time a fight at an after hours Club ends in gunfire but this time Family says the innocent woman was shot by someone she trusted here's Gabby Hart just doesn't feel fair that she's gone 23 year old princess Ortega was shot and killed on July 8th it happened outside of an after-hour club called karma located on South Gessner near the West Park Tollway seventeen-year-old Jermaine tortoise has been arrested and charged with her murder her mother and sister who chose not to show their faces say their family had just recently met tortoise but he was the half-brother of their cousin making him a part of the family as well because she just wanted them she just wanted to stop the fight her sister tells Fox 26 the night of the shooting princess was with tortoise and her other cousin along with a few other young men they say the men she was with got into an altercation inside of the club with another group of men that argument spilled outside my sister had gone out and gotten in the middle trying to stop the fight and that's when they claimed tortoise who was with the group standing behind princess opened fire that my sister was still in the middle when the shots first start started saying it wasn't just one shot that he fired it was one after another but she got hit in the back princess a wife and mother of three young children died in that parking lot paramedics also rushed a second victim described as a 29 year old man to the hospital in critical condition according to the detectives there was only shots from his side so he was the only one shot of firing princess's family says it's a harsh reality knowing that the man accused of this shooting was someone that princess knew and trusted and someone who should have been protecting her and he was firing the shots and he must have seen what she fell but he didn't even stop when he stopped he didn't stay and help he ran a bizarre jugging incident targets a local landscaping crew but this wasn't any simple robbery that's for sure here's Fox 26's Randy Wallace anything could have happened and to be honest I didn't want to lose my life this landscaper asked not to be identified so we'll call him Mike he has five guys who work with him Friday the 30th was payday I went ahead then went to the bank uh while my guys were working here Mike didn't know it at the time but a black jaguar followed him from the bank at Kirby and Bissonnet back to his job site in the 3700 block of Purdue near West U this uh Mass person got um got tried I got to get into my truck and and took my money and I started wrestling with him the master robber pulled a gun on Mike it was uh it was paycheck for the guys so I was like one way or another I need to get try to get that money because there was no way to recover that money the five guys working nearby went after the robber they approached him with a like a a hoe and I started hitting him and he ended up running some other different way the robber left the running Jaguar behind so Mike jumped in I got into his car and I was going to pursue him on his own car but I wasn't able to because I didn't know how to maneuver that car is it was a really nice newer model the robber returned in a second getaway car he was after the jaguar and his phone once again he pulled a gun on Mike but didn't fire yes I thank God for that Mike says it's been hard to recover from the money he lost he's married with kids and the families Sole Provider I have to keep working I have to keep doing what I do because it's the only thing I know how to do a magnolia man went before a federal judge this week charged with running a sex torsion scheme he's accused of hacking into hundreds of victims personal social media accounts and blackmailing them with their own intimate photos and videos Fox 26's Shelby Rose looks at this case and how often it happens strangers online are just as dangerous as strangers in real life this is 23 year old Andrew Venegas a magnolia man now federally charged with running a nationwide sex extortion scheme allegedly hacking into the personal social media accounts of more than a thousand victims across the country many of them under 18 accessing their intimate photos and videos and using them for blackmail do you have children out there who are believing the lies they're being fed by these extorters that is your world's going to crumble unless dot dot it's really just a crime of opportunity targeting anybody online in some instances court records say Venegas posted them on a website and would blackmail the victims saying they either had to send more or pay him through Bitcoin for them to get deleted the FBI says schemes like this is more common than you may realize we see an exponential increase but we think that it would be equal if not great later the number of victims that are potentially out there that are suffering in silence they claim it's one of the most underreported crimes due to the shame and guilt associated with it and Martinez says they have seen an increase of victim suicides that result from these crimes so they urge parents to have an open discussion with their children so it will get reported if it does happen the biggest thing that you can do for your child is to let them know that you are there let them feel comfortable to tell you and then also evidence shipper says it's important to reiterate to your kids to never delete anything even if it may be embarrassing because this evidence not only helps prosecution but it's Paramount to investigators to find out who the perpetrator is and if there are any other victims but it's still very difficult for the FBI to catch them it's very very difficult to one locate them and then two actually once they are located have the evidence in order to uh show that they were behind the actual crimes only on Fox a terrifying two months for one Houston woman known as a social media influencer who we're told is being detained in Dubai Fox 26's Dominique Keith explains it all it also could result in prison time so it's very scary the trip turned terrifying for Tierra young Allen when her mom says she was a passenger in a friend's rental car and they got into an accident there in Dubai Tina Baxter says when her daughter went to the company to retrieve her ID credit card and other items left in the rental Baxter says it did not go well she found out that she could only receive those items if she paid an undisclosed amount of money she dealt with a very aggressive individual a young man there who was screaming at her Baxter says her 29 year old daughter ultimately yelled back at the rental car agent she says resulting in her being charged for screaming there in Dubai and so she is in jail for one reason and one reason alone she raised her voice in that country a female is not even allowed to raise her voice if she raises her voice it's punishable by jail time it's been very emotional there are some days I stay up all night crying they have a strict law system that is really based on theocracy this website warns quote laws and customs are very different so be aware of your actions to ensure they don't offend while in United Arab Emirates now after Baxter says her daughter was charged with screaming in Dubai her passport has been taken and the American social media influencer who works as a truck driver can't leave the UAE according to her mom and her mom says she's been placed under a travel ban pending the outcome of the investigation it's very frightening um the longer she's been there the more reality has started to kick in in our opinion she did not commit a crime don't punish women for doing the same thing a man can do in Dubai it's not fair and it's not right the 29 year old does now have an attorney there in Dubai and her mom says she's told she could face jail time because there is surveillance video of her screaming at the rental car agent now we and her loved ones have reached out to us and UAE embassies so is government assistance available to her do they plan to step in I'm still awaiting responses near downtown Houston I'm Donna Lee Keith Fox 26 news all right Donald Lee thanks and that can happen to just about anyone so what should Americans do and what should Americans know before travel abroad here's Fox 26's Gabby Hart that advice don't leave America acting like an American is absolutely a good advice senior legal analyst Chris tritico says I didn't know isn't enough to get you off the hook if you're caught breaking the law in a foreign country here you have to prove that you intended to violate the law in most circumstances but in other countries it probably does not matter for instance in Thailand spitting spitting on the sidewalk is a crime many Americans learned this the hard way like 29 year old Tierra Allen a Houston woman who's been detained in Dubai for two months now her charge screaming in public so it's very scary last week Fox 26's Dominique Keith spoke exclusively with Tiara's mother who claims that she got into a dispute with a worker at a rental company he yelled at Tiara and her crime was yelling back in that country a female is not even allowed to raise her voice the Middle East is a very Draconian place especially for women and so if you're going to travel in a place like the Middle East and you're a woman know that as miniscule as her offense may seem tritical says there's nothing the U.S government can do to get her off the hook you're subject to the law of that country in the United States can't just come in and say we're the United States let our people go many people see the high profile efforts to secure the freedom of people detained overseas like Brittany Greiner for example and they think those same efforts will happen for every American politics got them out there are other Americans detained in Russia that were not detained for political reasons and they're still detained in Russia take a few minutes to learn those customs and those laws like that that you should know before you go Gabby Hart Fox 26 News yeah that's good advice take a few minutes and learn those Customs only on Fox here tonight A Houston man is suing Acadia apartment complex and a security guard following a bizarre incident that left him facing criminal charges here's Fox 26's Randy Wallace I'm thinking I'm the one that called 9-1-1 you know and now I'm the one locked up that was just it was hard for me to accept Carlton border says he went to Kingsland West Apartments located at 18325 Kingsland Boulevard on September 21st of last year to visit a friend the security officer was downstairs uh and he just started yelling is there a problem and I had no idea he was directing that towards me because nothing was happening where I was the lawsuit accuses security guard Jose a Herrera of slamming a bag filled with Taco Bell food against borders head border says the altercation turned physical and then I turned around and I started asking what's going on why are you doing this border says the security guard pulled a stun gun on him that's when I caught 9-1-1 border says he left and put the strange encounter behind him but nearly two months later border is arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault he spent two days in jail the charges were dismissed due to insufficient evidence we've all heard of shopping while black we've all heard of driving while black but this is a new one this is now visiting a friend while black attorney George Edwards has found a lawsuit on boarders behalf the defendants are signal 88 AKA signal 88 security their security guard Herrera and Kingsland West Apartments why is Mr Herrera still employed at that apartment complex why does Mr Herrera not have an active license to be a security guard our client wasn't running from the police he wasn't threatening anybody he didn't have any weapons it was just really like unbelievable home burglaries are high in Houston but not all agree on how high but numbers don't really matter much what does is preventing them from happening here's Natalie hee I think that's a little bit shocking why do you think that is it does concern me and I I mean I work from home so basically I'm at home but hey don't come to my house because like any hook Texans we are we are waiting for them HPD detective Ken Neely who served over the robbery division for the last 16 years says overall burglary numbers are actually trending downward in the city I think the numbers are definitely misleading I've looked at our numbers and over the last three years the numbers in Houston Police that we responded to over the last three years has gone down contrary to popular belief the f most burglaries happen during the daytime when people are at work or at school detective nearly encourages people to invest in a security system surveillance cameras and avoid posting on social media when you're out of town we often recommend that people to post those pictures upon their return no one feels safe anymore truly you see as we mentioned these blatant crimes broad daylight people checking their mail taking out their trash walking their dogs running errands things we didn't used to see this lack of regard for human life Crime Stoppers believes the Brazen nature of these types of crimes caught on camera may have attributed to why many houstonians claim they don't feel safe anymore whether the numbers are up or dipped down we don't feel where we're where we need to be there's always more work to be done certainly the types of criminal activity the broad daylight the blatant um lack of regard for for others their lives their well-being and that is this week's Fox 26 Crime Files now

0nc8wpPA,The Houston Vibe,"Hurricanes in Atlantic , Cyclones in the Pacific. Dumbass Newby Weather men and news reporters. Duh","Atmospheric Conditions Across Atlantic Stifle Cyclone Development , Three Tropical Waves Monitored",https://newsbreak.com/n/0nc8wpPA,"Tropical Weather Update - July 25, 2023","A decent amount of Saharan dust continues to hover over a big part of the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico & the Caribbean. This will hinder any rapid development of tropical cyclones as drier air is pulled into the atmosphere. However, there are three tropical waves with a very low chance for development over the next 2-7 days. One tropical wave is in the eastern Caribbean, one is a few hundred miles south of Bermuda and the other is in the far east Atlantic.",that time of the afternoon where we give you an update on what's happening in the tropics we do have a couple of tropical waves that I need to tell you about and they are in the Atlantic Ocean and they could potentially head our way but for now we are going to be dealing with that big heat Dome still influencing our weather across Southeast Texas for the most part but we do have some waves that we will need to monitor the good news is that they are expected to develop very slowly so we likely have several days to watch these systems let's start off with tropical wave number one this one is over into the Eastern Caribbean Sea now and it is producing some showers and storms some of those storms making their way up into portions of Puerto Rico you can see San Juan Puerto Rico there we've got the Lesser Antilles over here and this is the system it's kind of disorganized but it is producing broadly scattered showers and storms across portions of the Eastern Caribbean and there's just a very low shot for development over the next two days just a 10 percent chance that over the next seven days just a very low 10 percent shot that this will develop general movement is off to the West so if it does develop it would try to push into the central Caribbean and get a little bit closer to us but for now development if it even happens is extremely slim as far as that shot for development we are not expecting much with that system as we head into the Western Atlantic you'll see we have another tropical wave and this one is a little bit closer to the U.S there's a chance this one could push close to the east coast of Florida maybe up towards the Carolina coast over the next week or so a zero percent chance for development for the next two days but a 10 shot for development over the next seven days this is generally tracking off to the West Northwest you can see Miami there Jacksonville there and notice they're kind of in that area where this could potentially head so this is basically just a fairly weak tropical wave right now producing some disorganized showers and storms a couple hundred miles south of Bermuda but as it tracks off to the West Northwest there's a shot that it could develop into a tropical Cyclone but only a 10 percent chance over the next week now let's fly all the way out to the Eastern Atlantic and this is the newest tropical way that has come off the coast of Africa and it does have a shot for development but just as I told you with the other two drop waves that chance for development likely will happen over a longer period of time likely over the next seven days and even then that shot for development very low at 20 percent so there you can see it just off of the west coast of Africa it likely will slowly but surely push off to the West Northwest and could get into the central or Western portions of the Atlantic over the next week to week and a half but at this point the chance for development very low the upper levels of the atmosphere are not very favorable for development and we still have quite a bit of that Saharan dust ushering in some drier air in the atmosphere so those things are kind of working against these systems getting stronger the majority of the Caribbean pretty quiet of course we have that first tropical wave that I showed you affecting portions of Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles off in the Eastern Caribbean but the rest of the Caribbean pretty quiet Gulf of Mexico fairly quiet nothing being monitored by the National Hurricane Center that would potentially be strengthening into a tropical depression tropical storm or hurricane at this point let's move over to the Eastern Pacific and we do have a few clusters of showers and storms near Central America and also up around Acapulco Puerto Vallarta Mexico City but nothing that is being monitored for additional tropical Cyclone development so we do have very warm sea surface temps still out there buoy temp pier near Miami close to 90 degrees so definitely a lot of warm water out there that would act as fuel for these potential tropical Cyclones if they were to get going also very warm Waters in the Caribbean Sea but we've still got that Saharan dust so that's kind of acting to hinder development even though we do have the very warm Waters of the Gulf of Mexico and also of the Caribbean waters are very warm still as well across much of the Atlantic of course in the northern portion of the Atlantic you do get much cooler Waters But Central Southern portions of the Atlantic we've got those temps mainly in the 80s so certainly water's warm enough to help those systems to grow strong and develop quickly but this is what's hindering a lot of that development this Saharan dust that just keeps moving off of the west coast of Africa it's traveling all the way across the Atlantic and a lot of that dust is also pushed into portions of the Caribbean and especially the Gulf of Mexico you can see even Houston getting in on some of that Dusty air as that southerly flow that onshore flow continues to push that dust hour away fortunately we're not expecting a ton of dust but it could still impact our air quality but as far as our tropical development it is going to keep that to a minimum because it's bringing in some dry air and we still have that heat dome in place that would help to steer away any tropical action so I don't expect anything hitting us anytime soon we've already had four name systems for the Atlantic tropical season so far the hurricane season Arlene Brett Cindy and Don if we do get one of those three waves to develop over the next couple of days or next seven days the next name on the list would be Emily and then if they all develop we'd have Emily Franklin and Gert of course these are the remainder of the names that will be put to use if necessary if we do get further development as far as our hurricane season of course we are nearing the end of month two of course hurricane season began on June 1st it goes all the way through November 30th and we're close to the end of the second month but we're now we're about to get into the peak or what is typically more of the peak of hurricane season that would be the months of August and September where that main Peak would be around September 10th so even though things are still quiet for us here don't let your guard down make sure that you download our Fox 26 weather app for tropical weather forecast cones our follow me feature hurricane watches warnings and a plethora of a ton of other alerts of course you've got radar on there so you can keep track of any Heavy Rain locally that we have and also anything else going on any other types of alerts that we may get of course with our air quality and that dust moving in we could get an air quality alert you can find that on our Fox 26 weather app as well so fortunately for Houston for Southeast Texas no tropical storms or hurricanes headed our way anytime soon in fact much of the U.S looks pretty safe right now the only issue for the U.S will be maybe the eastern coast of Florida and over towards the Carolinas with that one tropical wave over the next week if it gets into that area and if it even holds together the chance for that developing very very slim but of course we're watching it and you'll get your daily updates usually around 4 to 4 30 P.M every afternoon as long as we are in hurricane season and of course that is all the way through the end of November so check us out make sure to review your hurricane plan your emergency kit make sure you have everything that you need in that go over evacuation routes Insurance the best time to do that is when things are quiet like right now I'm Fox 26 meteorologist shade enjoy the rest of your day
0nZyIbmG,The Houston Vibe,"Above average Hurricane season? So far not a single storm, not even a tropical depression.",Tropical Storm Don Loses Strength While Meteorologists Monitor INVEST 95-L,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nZyIbmG,"Tropical Weather Forecast - July 23, 2023",Don is weakening but still hanging around in the Atlantic. The newly identified INVEST 95-L is struggling to become organized but should still be watched closely.,hi meteorologist John Dawson this is the Fox 26 tropical update just for YouTube glad you found us here and we are always here every day of hurricane season and I just want to sort of dive into things right away because we have been talking about Dawn for a very long time so that's going to be the headline is that basically Don is still there but beginning to fall apart a little bit we're going to examine Don a bit closer here in just a minute but here's the other thing that we're talking about in the Atlantic and that is invest 95 L if you'll remember uh last at the end of last week here formally identified as an area of interest from the National Hurricane Center it's not a tropical Cyclone yet so it doesn't have a number if it would be a depression it doesn't have a name but it's labeled as inves95l just to kind of help us keep track on what we're talking about and it and it's really struggling quite a bit at and we're going to look at the reasons why here in just a minute but note that the Hurricane Center had this up to a 70 percent chance at one point and now it's backed it all the way down to a 40 chance in a seven day period uh 30 chance in a two-day period so I really don't think it's going to be able to do anything over the next two days uh again you could see by the by the percentages there or the probabilities that the Hurricane Center has given it and I'm in agreement of that but once it gets a little bit further in this Orange area into the Lesser Antilles basically into the Caribbean I think that's when it might have a little bit of a better chance to kind of go in get into further development I haven't I'm not really showing water temperatures today but we've been talking about water temperatures for a while and you know that once you get into the Caribbean those are going to be higher and the higher the temperature it's always going to be a little bit more favorable for development but what we will be talking about at least is the Saharan dust so you'll notice this is a future cast product of the Saharan dust we're kind of getting that some kind of almost out ahead of where that you know orange section was this area of dust and that's not going to be helpful at all as far as the development of invest 95l into a tropical cycle the dust is not helpful for that so this little section there that kind of gets out ahead of that is definitely going to give it some problems but if it's able to kind of hang in there until it gets into and especially if it can kind of get in between some of these heavier layers of dust I think it's definitely going to have a better chance and again getting itself enough organized that the hurricane Senator would identified at least as a tropical depression and then maybe even a storm so we'll have to look into that I'm going to take a little sidebar here for just real quick uh for those folks who are in Southeast Texas uh Houston specifically that's of course what Fox 26 focuses on most of the time I know there's a lot of you out there that are not who are here for the tropical information but give me just a quick 30 45 seconds here to talk about the fact that look at all the Saharan dust in the Gulf of Mexico again this is a futurecast product and we are looking at Tuesday we were expecting some of this dust to make it all the way here into the Houston area and again so this is a future cast product so you know it give or take a little bit it's not going to be perfect but we're certainly looking like we're going to be able to transport some of that dust that's just filling the Gulf of Mexico right now up here into Southeast Texas and and so that means you're going to have those hazy Skies it also helps as far as making our sunsets and our sun rises just a little bit more spectacular when you get a little bit of those particulates kind of floating around in there just a little bit so maybe keep that in mind if you're up early or you know watching the sunset it might be some pretty nice ones coming up this week on Tuesday and Wednesday I think is kind of the time frame on some of that okay thanks for letting me take that time out there everybody let's get back to the focus on what we're doing here with the tropics and yes this little area right here this is where 95 L is so you can see there's a lot of activity kind of happening around it but that's not really the organized the actual low pressure itself is right about here and so when you kind of take a look at things a little bit more and you see where that is and then you look at these computer models that are now running on it that's one of the main reasons why the Hurricane Center give it this label of invest 95l because then it really starts churning away on our computer models and remember the modeling really needs that closed circulation at the surface to help Define it as a tropical system it does okay before that but really that's what we look for and so these are all just sort of sort of the beginnings of trying to get an idea of what's happening but it's a pretty consistent track on where this might be heading and the key note here and what will be different between this system and Dawn we're going to look at Don here in just a minute is the fact that this is certainly coming into proximity of more people look at all the land that this is going to potentially have a possibility of interacting with and Don not so much do you remember how Don's just kind of been spinning around down here in the Atlantic well here's the future uh the corn the forecast Conan remember the Hurricane Center always it's a five-day forecast cone right well we're only looking for maybe one more day here where we're going to be able to have the Hurricane Center interested in it this is falling apart quickly if you remember yesterday at this time just becoming a hurricane didn't last too long by now less than 24 hours it's now back down uh to a tropical storm but it's still 60 mile an hour wind so those are still some pretty uh powerful winds as far as the tropical storm is concerned and the speed has started to pick up as far as the movement and it's going to be heading to the Northeast now and as it moves over these cooler Waters it's just going to kind of lose any sort of ability to sort of hang on as a tropical system so another day it looks like tomorrow Monday at 1 p.m this is the world we're expecting uh to have a tropical depression most likely is what that will look like quick reminder if we do get a name on invest95l or any of or whenever we get the next name Emily will be the next name on the list so we're on uh that Don was the first hurricane that we've had this year um and we'll in the Atlantic and we'll kind of note that that it didn't last very long as a hurricane as far as Don is concerned I hope you're already following me on some social media here's that availability but also a quick reminder on YouTube the best way to find me is to search meteorologist John Dawson that brings you to my YouTube channel and that YouTube channel has all of my hurricane gear test products ways to kind of help you think about hurricane preparedness so if you get a second punch in meteorologist John Dawson on YouTube find my YouTube channel and look at some of those hurricane gear test items just to kind of see how you're doing with your preparations and maybe give you again some ideas of what else you can do to be even better prepared for Hurricane Season thanks for finding us today I hope you'll look us up again tomorrow all right let me go reset a few graphics and then we'll do us a heat wave foreign

It's a familiar issue that heats up every summer, but this year's debate has gotten even hotter Tuesday prison reform advocates held an emotional news conference at the state capitol with several state lawmakers, Representative Karl Sherman was among those taking part.",now across Texas the issue is I'm Rudy Koski in Austin I'm Stephen dial in Dallas and I'm Greg Grugan in Houston and this is Texas the issue is state prisons with no air conditioning it's a familiar issue that heats up every summer but this year with the current Heat Wave the debate has gotten even hotter Tuesday prison reform Advocates held an emotional news conference at the state capitol with several State lawmakers representative Carl Sherman was among those taking part and I spoke with him about why he believes an emergency response is needed now you should care about Humanity really what this comes down to is if you believe in public safety then you should care because those that are working in these conditions are suffering as well when are we gonna stand up and Rise Up when are we going to declare a state of emergency over our Texas prison system how much could this cost putting AC in all the units well let me just say this we actually appropriated over 500 million dollars for us to have AC and I can tell you what it is cost us in the past when you look at the cost that we've expensed on trying to address lawsuits spend millions of dollars and it's been less to actually install AC I'm sick and tired of dealing with rich people problems this is about survival what do you say to those who believe that this is just being soft on crime I understand uh and I get it they believe that but when temperatures are rising above 120 degrees inside sales that's inhumane that's indecent there are some Provisions that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice put into place cold water cold showers respite areas but guess what guys there's not enough staff to implement those policies the people in there are not getting the relief what they need is climate control and we're not talking about comfort we are talking about a matter of life and death we want it under 85 degrees and we want it this summer right now the state is putting some cooling spots into some of these locations why isn't that enough well when you are actually living in a four-story metal building under those conditions and you're taken out for respite when they can because we're understaffed we normally have about 20 000 correctional officers and now we're down to I think approximately the last number I saw 17 000 correctional officers they cannot address every citizen who has an issue regarding the Heat and so unfortunately those respite areas are not sufficient these are human beings they're not animals they're not pigs even the pig the pig climate control the TDCJ cares for we know that our things shouldn't be more valued than those that are made in His image whether you've done something wrong or whether you just didn't have a good legal team everyone deserves to be treated like a human you can be conservative but also being humanitarian and let's declare an emergency right now today you say that this is an emergency are you asking the governor to call a special session for this issue look the governor has a multiplicity of issues and challenges along with 30 million constituents who are certainly they have their priorities and you know I've never been a governor and so I don't know what it must be like to be in a seat there are a lot of important issues out there but this is one where people are dying and where our employees are getting sick and needing to be rushed to the hospital so this to me speaks to our humanity and response the resources are there you that are elected need to be responsible for making certain that the living conditions are above that of animal shelters for these inmates if there are conditions that we have control of that we can do something about that we who say to the counties you must have HD we say to the cities you must have AC then we ought to do it for ourselves so yes I think that there could be hypocrisy there if we're not doing it and that's on all of us 150 Representatives 31 Senators as well as the governor as well all of us have responsibility in this so I don't put this just on the governor after hearing that it sounds like the state's efforts to provide inmates with Summer relief has been Half Baked that's why my word is Half Baked Greg what's your word Rudy my word is overdue Stephen your word for what you just heard my word preventable we'll be back right after this break to talk about the interview and the state's response foreign the Texas Trio is back and Texas the issue is hot state prisons Greg they're about 128 000 people in the state prison system right now 14 units in Texas don't have AC 55 partial climate control a recent report estimates it'll cost about a billion dollars to put in some type of air conditioning system everywhere is that a hard sell in Houston you know Rudy I really don't think folks in this town are opposed to climate control in the Texas clink While most folks are absolutely against transforming prison units into comfy extended stay hotels they totally get the Practical side of this request even under optimal conditions incarcerating people with a propensity for violence at extremely close quarters is challenging but when you subject both inmates and prison guards to miserable unrelenting heat it's not difficult to see how conditions can get volatile really fast so even those who have little empathy for inmates see the the pragmatism of preserving safety for Corrections Officers performing a very tough job for very modest pay Stephen TDCJ has made some upgrades recently claiming AC has been provided to 9 400 beds since 2018 but the state senate during the regular season session failed to move that house bill that allocated 500 million dollars to do more work which is why my word was half baked a few years ago I'd say the lieutenant governor sidesteps this decision with ease but our lawmakers up in north Texas giving him a free pass now I don't think anyone's given a free pass I think it's just getting maybe overlooked by some other pressing issues the reason why I said this is preventable the last time I checked we live in the United States regardless of someone is an inmate or not having basic AC and plus 100 temperatures like we've been having consistently this summer and past summers just sounds like a normal thing to do and you're subjecting your prison guards and workers to the same inhumane condition so I don't understand why this hasn't been addressed I don't know of a free pass is being given but it certainly can be easily handled yeah it certainly sounds like that they dropped the ball on the Senate side Greg Houston Democrat John Whitmire speaking about the Senate is a tough on crime politician he's pushed major criminal reform plans while in the Senate now he's leaving the Senate to run for the mayor of Houston does this issue follow him in that campaign good question my guess is not really you have to remember the city of Houston just endured one of the worst violent crime waves in its modern history I'd say most voters here are far more focused on keeping convicted Predators locked up than they are improving conditions for serial law Breakers during their incarceration now that said I don't see how anyone can pin lack of air conditioning on chairman Whitmire a Democrat when Republicans have controlled the state budget for the past quarter century and Justice session had a surplus of 33 billion dollars to draw on this is for both of you the governor has some discretionary money available does it use that for a quick fix does he call us special session or does he just ignore it Greg what do you think Rudy I think the Practical course is using discretionary cash in an emergency response to a weather-related crisis if anything to preserve the health and safety of prison staff and inmates and hopefully potential unrest that could easily spiral out of control I don't need to remind you guys we haven't even hit August yet foreign yeah I I don't think there will be a special session definitely they're not going to do that now can the governor use discretionary funds sure but he could have did that before the session he could have did that last year this is an ongoing issue so I personally don't see anything changing I don't know the pressure is going to get up hot and high as the summer moves on we'll have to wait and see on this one to see this interview or any of our past interviews go to our YouTube pages and keep the conversation going by interacting with us on social media the Texas Trio will be back next week with Senator John cornyn who says thousands of Migrant children are missing and the Biden Administration isn't doing near enough to find them in the meantime don't forget to let us know what you think the issue is [Music]

California legislators signed it into law and it went into effect in January of 2022. I think that this law was well intentioned but I don't think it was well thought out the intent of ab30 is to battle racial discrimination in jury selection but gastronovo says what it's really doing is making it more difficult to convict people for criminal Behavior Megan's case is exhibit a showing the problems with this law I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared I was frightened on September 4th 2019 former San Bernardino sheriff's deputy Megan McCarthy responded to a domestic violence call when McCarthy tried to detain the suspect he began punching her grabbed her gun and opened fire a neighbor recorded the attack on a cell phone they heard the 911 call they heard my audio recording they heard from other Witnesses they heard from plenty of people and it just wasn't compelling enough in May the attacker was acquitted of attempted murder an assault and a police officer with a firearm instead the jury found Ari young guilty of a lesser charge negligent discharge of a firearm McCarthy believes it's a direct result of ab3070 which does not allow attorneys to remove a juror showing bias against law enforcement I think it's just really sad that you know video proof of a crime isn't enough for people anymore many of the jurors that sat on the jury that heard her case expressed a bias towards police officers and under the new law they could not be removed from the jury just because they expressed a bias towards police and so quite literally the deck was stacked against her being the victim of a crime this new law also States jurors cannot be dismissed if they seem inattentive or provide unintelligent or confused answers how can your client get a fair trial if you have jurors that are inattentive not giving intelligent answers and you can't excuse those folks ab3070 was opposed by numerous Public Safety organizations and the association of Deputy District Attorneys longtime prosecutor John McKinney explains why challenge now if you're a prosecutor who often relies on the testimony of police officers in some capacity sometimes they're a victim sometimes they're a witness sometimes they're an investigator but there's almost always at least one police officer testifying in a case how do you get a criminal conviction when you have two or three jurors sitting on a jury who have openly said that they have animus and biased toward police officer what's going to happen is you're going to get more hung juries which is a waste of taxpayers money or Worse you're going to get criminals being acquitted which means victims are not going to get Justice currently ab3070 affects criminal trials it will also be applied to civil trials beginning in 2026.

says about extreme heat waves and how climate change is impacting our weather you're watching The Rundown hello everyone I'm Robin Winston we'll have more on those stories in a moment but first an attorney for a woman who was punched by an L.A County Sheriff's deputy is announcing a lawsuit we want to warn you the video of the altercation may be hard to watch baby this happened in Palmdale a year ago the sheriff's department said when deputies pulled over a vehicle they found an intoxicated driver and three women holding babies instead of using car seats one of the mothers refused to give up her child and that's when the deputy punched her she's now planning to file a civil rights lawsuit Sheriff Robert Luna called the deputy's actions unacceptable and turn the case over to the FBI as well as local prosecutors a murder investigation is underway in Rancho Palos Verde so man and a woman were found shot to death inside a car the victims were found in a blue Subaru parked at a popular ocean Lookout Monday morning they've been identified as 36 year old Jorge Ramos and 26 year old Taylor Raven Whitaker people who visit the area which is near the upscale Terranea Resort say the situation is concerning investigators are releasing much information yet to set multiple shots were fired at a fairly close range we're now hearing from the man who claims in LA county sheriff's deputy punched him outside a 7-Eleven store in Whittier that altercation was all caught on camera Emmett Brock says he first saw the deputy berating a woman on the side of the road and he flipped the deputy off then he saw the same Deputy following him without using any lights or sirens for three minutes when they finally pulled up to the 7-Eleven parking lot and got out of the cars the deputy pin Brock to the ground he starts to punch me about 10 times and repeatedly shoves my head down into the pavement Brock says when deputies at the jail learned he was a transgender man they also asked to show his private parts well he's now demanding accountability from the sheriff's department the agency declined to comment on the allegations but says it takes excessive force claims seriously and it's investigating this matter as we enter what could be the hottest days of our current heat wave a group of scientists are releasing some startling findings they say this unrelenting heat would have been virtually impossible without climate change being brought on by human activity LX news climate editor Chase Kane takes a closer look at what's driving the Heat if you live in Dallas or Phoenix or any hot place over the last few weeks what if someone said during these heat waves we could turn down the heat by as much as four degrees or if they said you didn't have to experience this heat wave at all that's basically the findings from these six scientists at World weather attribution in Europe they said without climate change this heat wave in the U.S wouldn't have happened it was virtually impossible but the most important thing is that they kill people I and they protect particle and hurt and Destroy lives and livelihoods of those most vulnerable and so really it is about us and how climate change how these heat waves are impacting us we know heat is the number one weather related killer around the world and here in the United States to come up with these findings they basically look at past climate data and they have models which are peer reviewed they sort of plug in the numbers from this most recent Heat Wave alongside past climate and they say when you do that that from a scientific perspective it's almost boring because the data the link the tie there is so strong between climate change and how it is driving heat waves like this as long as we keep burning fossil fuels we will see more and more of these extremes and it could well be that this is what will be a few a cool summer in the future if we don't stop earning fossil fuels and so that leaves us with a Clear Choice do we want these heat waves of today to be sort of as bad as it gets or do we keep burning fossil fuels and making heat waves like this more frequent last longer and even hotter than they already are all right let's get a check of your hot weather forecast with meteorologist Belen de Leon I know it's been hot lately but the temperatures are going up even more heat advisories have been issued four spots away from the coast that's the mountains The Valleys the Inland Empire and an excessive heat warning in effect for the low desert from Tuesday morning all the way through Wednesday evening temperatures in this area expected to be well above normal with an elevated risk for heat illness hydrate and stay cool now even though after Wednesday that advisory is supposed to expire I think they may be extended here's the reason why the temperatures are not going to get out of the triple digits look at the trend in Santa Clarita 105 Tuesday and Wednesday then low 100s straight into the weekend it's not until early next week when the temperatures lower and it feels a little cooler but even then temperatures will be above normal through the end of the month an unstable portion of

their new high-tech teammate without the SOS service from iPhone I don't know when or if we would have ever found him what if you hadn't got to him most likely he would have bled out at some point getting to him in a timely manner is what saved him so here's how it works the iPhone detects when you're in a severe crash or accident it immediately puts you in contact with the nearest 9-1-1 call

says about extreme heat waves and how climate change is impacting our weather you're watching The Rundown hello everyone I'm Robin Winston we'll have more on those stories in a moment but first an attorney for a woman who was punched by an L.A County Sheriff's deputy is announcing a lawsuit we want to warn you the video of the altercation may be hard to watch baby this happened in Palmdale a year ago the sheriff's department said when deputies pulled over a vehicle they found an intoxicated driver and three women holding babies instead of using car seats one of the mothers refused to give up her child and that's when the deputy punched her she's now planning to file a civil rights lawsuit Sheriff Robert Luna called the deputy's actions unacceptable and turn the case over to the FBI as well as local prosecutors a murder investigation is underway in Rancho Palos Verde so man and a woman were found shot to death inside a car the victims were found in a blue Subaru parked at a popular ocean Lookout Monday morning they've been identified as 36 year old Jorge Ramos and 26 year old Taylor Raven Whitaker people who visit the area which is near the upscale Terranea Resort say the situation is concerning investigators are releasing much information yet to set multiple shots were fired at a fairly close range we're now hearing from the man who claims in LA county sheriff's deputy punched him outside a 7-Eleven store in Whittier that altercation was all caught on camera Emmett Brock says he first saw the deputy berating a woman on the side of the road and he flipped the deputy off then he saw the same Deputy following him without using any lights or sirens for three minutes when they finally pulled up to the 7-Eleven parking lot and got out of the cars the deputy pin Brock to the ground he starts to punch me about 10 times and repeatedly shoves my head down into the pavement Brock says when deputies at the jail learned he was a transgender man they also asked to show his private parts well he's now demanding accountability from the sheriff's department the agency declined to comment on the allegations but says it takes excessive force claims seriously and it's investigating this matter as we enter what could be the hottest days of our current heat wave a group of scientists are releasing some startling findings they say this unrelenting heat would have been virtually impossible without climate change being brought on by human activity LX news climate editor Chase Kane takes a closer look at what's driving the Heat if you live in Dallas or Phoenix or any hot place over the last few weeks what if someone said during these heat waves we could turn down the heat by as much as four degrees or if they said you didn't have to experience this heat wave at all that's basically the findings from these six scientists at World weather attribution in Europe they said without climate change this heat wave in the U.S wouldn't have happened it was virtually impossible but the most important thing is that they kill people I and they protect particle and hurt and Destroy lives and livelihoods of those most vulnerable and so really it is about us and how climate change how these heat waves are impacting us we know heat is the number one weather related killer around the world and here in the United States to come up with these findings they basically look at past climate data and they have models which are peer reviewed they sort of plug in the numbers from this most recent Heat Wave alongside past climate and they say when you do that that from a scientific perspective it's almost boring because the data the link the tie there is so strong between climate change and how it is driving heat waves like this as long as we keep burning fossil fuels we will see more and more of these extremes and it could well be that this is what will be a few a cool summer in the future if we don't stop earning fossil fuels and so that leaves us with a Clear Choice do we want these heat waves of today to be sort of as bad as it gets or do we keep burning fossil fuels and making heat waves like this more frequent last longer and even hotter than they already are all right let's get a check of your hot weather forecast with meteorologist Belen de Leon I know it's been hot lately but the temperatures are going up even more heat advisories have been issued four spots away from the coast that's the mountains The Valleys the Inland Empire and an excessive heat warning in effect for the low desert from Tuesday morning all the way through Wednesday evening temperatures in this area expected to be well above normal with an elevated risk for heat illness hydrate and stay cool now even though after Wednesday that advisory is supposed to expire I think they may be extended here's the reason why the temperatures are not going to get out of the triple digits look at the trend in Santa Clarita 105 Tuesday and Wednesday then low 100s straight into the weekend it's not until early next week when the temperatures lower and it feels a little cooler but even then temperatures will be above normal through the end of the month an unstable portion of the Bluffs in Santa Monica is prompting an emergency closure starting Tuesday night there will be closures along PCH as Crews use a large crane to remove the top portion of the bluff and break it apart so here's the area we're talking about it's near the Arizona pedestrian bridge off of Ocean and Santa Monica Boulevard and we're told the work should be done by Wednesday afternoon a car plunged 400 feet off a road in the Angeles National Forest and the driver has his iPhone to thank for helping First Responders find him this wooded area is where the driver went off a cliff last Friday night the only reason search and rescue was able to locate the injured driver was because of new crash detection technology a newer model Apple products the LA County Sheriff's Department is grateful for their new high-tech teammate without the SOS service from iPhone I don't know when or if we would have ever found him what if you hadn't got to him most likely he would have bled out at some point getting to him in a timely manner is what saved him so here's how it works the iPhone detects when you're in a severe crash or accident it immediately puts you in contact with the nearest 9-1-1 call center but if you don't have cell service like the driver entered Friday the phone will still call for help via satellite in just over a week Taylor Swift brings her Blockbuster sold-out era's tour to Sofi stadium and Metro wants to help fans get to and from the venue so Metro will extend service to around 2 A.M there will also be a free shuttle to The Stadium from the downtown Inglewood k-line

local businesses are filling the Fallout of the strike and are taking an economic hit NBC 4's Ted chin has that story it is a very fine line uh we're walking right now Lawless Brewing Company in North Hollywood is still making their popular craft beers but since many of their customers are on picket lines right now they've had to adjust as a small business it is a huge concern that a lot of our customer base is out of work right now so they don't have money to spend they're not going out for lunch or they're not doing the takeout Nancy Hoffman vanyak of the greater San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce says the situation reminds her of the closing of the General Motors plan in the early 90s that cost more than 2500 jobs and had a ripple effect on businesses throughout the valley we started seeing the restaurants across the street close or cut their outs and a lot of those places are have been completely gone ever since they've never come back Flawless Brewing says they're surviving on the Goodwill of customers who are now bringing in more of their friends they've also become a Gathering Place for picketers even if they're not buying as much beer as they used to it's just it's like an uncertain uh future for them and and all of us really right now and unlike during the worst of the pandemic the restaurant says at least people can still come together we're trying to create a place where you can go here and you can hopefully afford it we're doing what we can and we're just taking it day by day pretty much a strike isn't just about the studio and these workers

year's might be the best one yet especially for fans of the late Lakers Legend Kobe Bryant so on Friday September 1st the Dodgers will be handing out these black mamba baseball jerseys pretty cool right I like them they're inspired by the jerseys the Lakers wore during their run to the NBA Championship following Kobe's death back in 2020. they're all black with a gold outlined and Mamba scales across the Jersey they feature both of Kobe's numbers 8 and 24. now it's important to know that these jerseys will only be available to fans who purchase a special event ticket pack and it's not a

forget to subscribe to the channel leave your like and activate the notification Bell write in the comments which city you are watching the roster for the Los Angeles Lakers 2023-20 for season is nearly complete the purple and gold presently have 13 players on the roster with the majority of the rotation filled the squad can make some minor changes but nothing major the lineup that begins the season is not necessarily the same as the team that finishes the season consider last year Los Angeles began the season with an uninspiring Squad led by a major Russell Westbrook issue but concluded with a promising young Corps that was younger this summer The Club brought back the majority of that core and improved on it because of the additions made this off-season many believe the Lakers are a viable title Contender that is precisely where the team wishes to be while the roster is now fixed the lake show is prepared to Pivot and make a large move if necessary with the deal he was given the organization has all the confirmed that D'Angelo Russell will be traded at some point Los Angeles will not act until the deadline or near to it while that is still a ways off there are a lot of intriguing possibilities on the horizon there are numerous notable names that the Lakers might acquire in January or February to form a projected big three Zach lavini is one of those well-known names with links to Los Angeles and a cause to desire to play for the purple and gold depending on how the 2023-20 for season unfolds the lake show might make a trade for the All-Star let's go out what that hypothetical deal would look like and assign ratings to both sides in action Zach lavini has one of the highest salaries in the league but the Lakers have the salary cap to make it happen the franchise May package D'Angelo Russell with another race on player to fit it under the NBAs trade rules only Russell and Hackamore are required for this trade to be financially viable but the Bulls will almost certainly want more with only a few selections to trade to Chicago the Lakers would almost surely ask for yolen hugefino despite being selected in the 2023 NBA draft JHS is not expected to play a significant role in his rookie season what would it take for both parties to reach a point where this makes sense first Chicago would have to have another terrible season and realize that contending isn't a realistic possibility the team is currently sure that it can compete for a championship by February the team may recognize that is unrealistic and may wish to get rid of lavini before things go to bad the Lakers require some difficulty and pressure from their Superstars if the Lake Show goes well the club will most likely contemplate a smaller move with Russell however if the season gets off to a rocky start LeBron James may decide to use his clout to negotiate a la Vinnie deal leave your opinion in the comments thank you for watching if you like the video be sure to

0nfYVRVt,The NYC Vibe,the NYPD radio system and equipment are NOT obsolete nor is encryption warranted for dispatch frequencies,"NYPD Officials Address Radio Encryption, Teen Gun Violence, and Ongoing Investigations in Recent Press Conference",https://newsbreak.com/n/0nfYVRVt,Watch live as NYPD executives take questions from the media,Watch live as NYPD executives take questions from the media,chief of detectives James essig chief of Information Technology Ruben Beltran and Deputy Commissioner of Community Affairs Mark Stewart have any questions it's such a nice microphone um so question for chief Beltran my colleague reported this week on the NYPD encrypting radio frequencies in six precincts in Brooklyn North is this going to be expanded out city-wide and is there going to be a carve out for the Press where they'll still be able to access the frequencies [Music] 40 year old technology that we're upgrading from is a multi-year process in terms in terms of preparing the infrastructure to support that upgrade so so we will be expanding it and we've been looking at other cities and we continue to explore other options to enable media access uh consistent with what the technology supports and and what other cities the successor of the cities are having so are you limited I'm sorry we got Julia Papa yes thank you good afternoon so would you be limiting then uh for anybody to particular precincts only or does that expand or how is that going to work borrow to borrow digital upgrade capabilities under that digital upgrade to also be deployed Citywide dollar miles ABC a few follow-up questions with that 40 year old technology but is the department having any difficulty with interference with other actors on The Frequency broadcasting the frequencies and so is part of the motivation to keep certain individuals off the frequency and then secondly um the NYPD has a lot of Partners in the community so how do you plan to respond uh communicate with the FDNY and other agencies during a big emergency if you guys are encrypted and others are not so so we have a uh a history of of our radios being used against us our radios one of the most important Technologies one of the important most important tools that we provide to police officers and that we train them in and and because it's more important than their firearm and anything else that they have in terms of being able to respond to incidents uh to also uh being able to to request assistance so so that that capability is thwarted because because more or less our our licensed to use those frequencies on those channels but they're also hijacked by sometimes our adversaries and Bad actors who look to do exactly that showing up type of uh obstacle that may present for the Department well I think we do have some people that intentionally try to disrupt our mission critical communication do you have to do this right so so I think that those are those are the groups of people that are out there that's why we're exploring uh these capabilities you mentioned the question the second part of your question was about Partners we've been in communication with our partners we have memorandums of understandings with people with other First Responders and other other groups uh EMS uh other groups outside the city that we share Communications with and we've been in communication with them about this upgrade and and we were providing assistance to them so they can enable access to our systems and and we're going to continue to do that as we move forward it's going great next question is going to be from Steve hi I'm a freelance photographer covering a lot of breaking news in the city and will you be allowing media access to uh the encryption because it seems awfully suspicious to encrypt them yes you're upgrading technology but without giving any specific examples of interference um you know can you tell us about one instance of interference with the radios oh we we have uh like I said we have a history so I think we can provide examples of that history through dcpi um I won't do that now because the type of interference like I said is widespread that we have a lot of examples that we can share with the media recognition of trusted leaders because our common enemy here is false information on social media you have all these people on the street with cell phones telling everyone uh what they think happened doesn't don't you see the importance of having news organizations that have a relationship with you guys to be able to have access to this information so in addition to digital uh technology and Communications and radio encryption has been out there for a while we've used encryption for a while on on for years on certain channels other cities have gone encrypted and have dealt with these issues also that's why we're exploring to see what's the best option to strike that balance between keeping police officers safe keeping the community safe and making sure that there's appropriate media access and information for transparency all right next question will be from Usman from loud labs good morning uh last year Chicago encrypted their frequencies and uh San Francisco I just wanted to ask Will there be access to the media through like an app like broadcastify on a 15 to 30 minute delay because it seems like you're not really giving like examples of what are you trying to provide media access even though it's a 40-year-old technology so part of our research part of our implementation and and instituting this new technology is looking to see what those other cities have done so that's all part of the exploration and research process all right we're going to go over to uh John Doyle from CBS uh this question is foreign Chief um just two questions July 19th um there's a video floating around of a yellow cab driver that was beaten by a uh by a few pastors I understand they have two arrests and one of the questions last night in the six seven Precinct a 16 year old girl was hit um allegedly by a stray bullet um and just any update you have on that case cab driver being beaten there was two arrests by responding Patrol officers the detective bureaus endeavoring to identify the three to four other males who are involved in that as far as yesterday's shooting that was last night at Utica and Linden Boulevard we have a male who was a works as a security off or guard in Brooklyn is getting off work as he's exiting the bus there's a group of kids but he describes this younger gentleman who were prevented him from getting off the bus there was some sort of dispute he notices a firearm he flees shots were fired he was struck and the unintended 16 year old was struck too so that that's about 12 hours old and uh we are detect detectives are out there right now scouring the area for video I'm sorry she's just done a cab driver do they know if these were passengers that in his cab and what the dispute was about don't know what the dispute was about right now um but you know they weren't passengers in the vehicle as far as we could tell all right next question will be from olya hi um I'm asking about encryption again so if everybody asked the same question what access would press have and I I don't feel like I kind of heard the answer quite yet and I mean the encryption already began so we're already having an issue to where we can't accept like access certain neighborhoods and I mean I feel like there should be a more clear response to how where media is going to be with all of this you know because even if it's a 30 minute delay that's also an issue for accountability for a lot of other things that are important for us well like like you mentioned before we already have three zones that are encrypted but we have dozens of zones in the police department and the infrastructure to support converting all those zones to uh to digital and to encryption are still more than a year and a half away so so it is a I know it is a concern I've discussed it with uh with members of uh members that represent you in terms of for this particular issue and we are exploring every possibility to strike that right balance like we said before all right we're gonna go over to Juliet pop at 10 10 wins yeah yeah for Deputy Commissioner Stewart talk about other concerns regarding teen on teen gun violence you know the Borough president of the Bronx just about a week and a half ago had a big news conference after Fourth of July weekend so many young people were shooting and shooting at each other uh is there a plan to address this and what's involved yes our plan that we have is to set up programs for all Youth and our kids to attend we understand that we can't have them in the streets with nothing to do so we have a options program in the Bronx you have one in Brooklyn and we have one in Queens officer program we teach our young kids how to de-escalate situations we teach our finances we have a weight room we keep them occupied on different activities that they could do because our main concern is that they're not hanging on on the street and what we do teach them is life experiences how if they get approached by a gang member how to answer it and it's the virtue of a reality it's a headset that they put on they can answer like yes or no because nowadays in our technology we have to engage them so our main point is to Mentor them and get them to understand how the streets and how the streets could be a disaster to them but we also have to take our programs and understand that there's a lot of kids that say listen we were in a gray area without these programs I could have made a left but they made a right I think sometimes that we concentrate on the few bad apples who are not doing that well and the programs we have we have an Explorer from a program too we have over 1700 kids we have the syep with the mayor who uh last year we had eight 800 kids this year he invested more so we have over a thousand kids you know some of you can unemployment given all the presets they're an old housing they're an old Transit they're in our Aviation they're in a harbor so your main goal here is to show them that there's other ways and another way that we benefit from these factors with these kids is that they get to tell us about their communities and what's going on in our communities that we're able to send our Community Affairs officers to teach communities and then we address it so we definitely tackle we know our number one uh our priority is Public Safety but our community is also comes comes first too so the more knowledge that we get about our teams that we'll keep these programs going and listen and those teams who did make a left we think we're not going to give up on them we got to keep showing up to let them know that we're we're still here and we're engaging in them all right we're gonna take one or two more questions uh the Tina Moore New York Post hi sorry to hear jumping around on you but Chief essec this is for you um back to the cab driver I know you said there were two arrests the DA's has no record of that did they get dats the two people do you know they were charged uh with the software they're actually charged with assault and the other three guys are just in the wind right all right and again you don't know what the dispute was about right okay definitely looking at four additional persons all right uh we're gonna go over to Mark Morales CNN hey guys how you doing uh first question was about radio encryption and I I know that there's going to be all these upgrades that are coming but is there going to be anything in addition to just the nature of encryption which is people can't listen in like will any of these radio Transmissions be stored for any amount of time will it be used as evidence or discovering any sort of cases does that even is any of that going to happen at all like is it is there any like like what other upgrades are we going to have in addition to that if any yeah required to uh that were required to disseminate in terms of an arrest Freedom of Information all that will continue to be maintained and and we will be able to get that post incident so that's all the current system is going to stay the same in terms of how we retrieve information request for information uh after an incident uh I think the issue here is really a real-time Communications of our of our mission critical voice all right we're gonna start winding down folks we got one or two more questions Tom Tracy Daily News hi thank you very much for taking a minute uh real quick the um regarding the encryption um volunteer ambulance services like Community groups that kind of thing have you already in that in those communities where it went dark are you sharing the encryption code so they can access so the volunteer ambulance course can go and like respond imagine this community uh right radio experts radio technicians radio enthusiasts and and emergency responders they're a tight-knit community so we're in communication with all our partners who have who work with us and have agreements with us to Monitor and transmit on our Radio Systems they know the changes that we're making they know what they need to do to be able to get access some of them have done that already so in the progress of doing it and we're going to continue to do that for not just the people within New York City that are our partners and First Responders but also neighboring communities and neighborhood counties by the way many of which are already encrypted so and what would you say just uh you know just you know just for the critics that say that this is just another way of stopping transparency in the NYPD that you're stopping people from getting this information on a timely basis what's your response there I've worked I.T around 14 years in this police department and I'm excited that we are introducing new viable technology that helps keep the public safe and help keeps helps keep our police officers safe that's what I would say to them all right our final question will be from John Doyle CBS she's actually I just had one last question I'm concerning the um uh stabbing in Midtown North on the pier um I understand uh those interests made and the man's being brought back um uh for court um can you just tell a recap the case and just tell us about the suspect so that was uh on West 44th Street and 12th Avenue and it occurs on Thursday July 13th we have a male or later arrest and I'll give this information out PC social media uh posts that were Disturbed him I I believe he's seen his girlfriend dancing with another male and he vowed to stamped the first person he's seen he goes down and there's a male 35 years old individual sleeping on the bench and he stabs him causing us demise detectives were able to get information that he took an Amtrak Amtrak train out to Chicago Illinois we alerted Chicago Illinois he was brought back yesterday um he is being charged with murder in the second degree his name is Louis Gill he was also charged with a tenth Precinct robbery in which he uh stole the money and marijuana from an individual and that that robbery was from earlier in July yeah Chief could you talk about the chain snatching pattern in the Bronx and also another pattern of phone theft on the e-bikes in Manhattan so we have two two patterns that we call Patton's grand larceny and this is a common theme we've seen I believe Chief shell talked about it with our scooters electric bikes bicycles very easy to get away so in one case in Manhattan we have uh three cases between June 26th and June 27th that they're all on the upper west side all three victims properties all that taken from their hand or their bicycle we have very good images out of a blue scooter uh multi-colored shirt uh and again that's a Common Thread with our robberies our grand laws and these even our shootings when you see two individuals on a scooter usually the back one shoots in the Bronx uh eight cases between June 25th and July 14th these are two individuals in a dark color mopeds they snatch chains off all female victims uh sometimes they push them to the ground again good images out these are happening in the Riverdale section and uh Eastchester section of the Bronx

🎧Listen:https://art19.com/shows/takeoff-with-john-clark",and you heard Tom and Reuben just to ask Alec Baume about Rob Thompson addressing the team and and boom said hell we earned it and he air it sounds like that Thompson in no small way made it clear that they needed to play better and he said we got to move on but he was right and they did move on they responded does it always work like that when a manager airs out his team it doesn't always work out like that and you definitely don't expect it from Rob Thompson who's about as even killed a manager as you're ever going to see but there are times when you just have to get into it a little bit with your with your team and whether that comes from a coach or a manager or a fellow teammate but yeah they needed something to go on to transpire because the brand of baseball that they've played the last couple days in Pittsburgh very uninspiring but they ready the ship today uh granted they left a lot of guys on base 11 to be exact and they were two for 12 with runners in scoring position but a w is a w talk about falling behind once again they're 16 and 36 coming into tonight's game 16 wins 36 losses if they're scored upon first it happened tonight courtesy of a home run Taiwan Walker allowed and he actually pitched quite well but they fought back and that showed a lot of grit it did show a lot of grit and I like the fact that you know I don't like the fact he gave up a tour on Homer in that first inning but you look at what he did able to go through six and two-thirds I said if they can get him to seven Innings just one out shy of that he saved the bullpen a little bit through 100 pitches only 56 for strikes but he did not have his best fastball and what I liked is that they got off the page they found other ways he threw a lot of Cutters tonight I threw some four seamers some more sinkers didn't have that velocity but was able to maintain a game plan moving forward and then was very very successful when you don't have your best stuff you have to find ways to pitch and that's exactly what Taiwan Walker did he did he ultimately looked pretty good let's talk to Reuben Amaro Jr about it back down to Miami and check in with reuben reuben last year is 4-0 two point 0.65 against Miami Taiwan Walker make that 5-0 going back to last season the era has got to be even lower he came in at a 4.05 and now he's at 3.99 and he pitched quite well after that first inning didn't he are you you said the word pitch I mean that's exactly what he did he didn't have his great stuff didn't have a great velocity he was at like 1991 with his fastball but you know he sunk the ball he cut it he threw his split quite a number of times but he figured out ways to get people out and uh that was one of the best efforts I've seen with a guy who just didn't really have great stuff um and it's a great thing to see the fact that he got his 12th win I mean this is everything you would have asked of a guy that you're you're calling your number three or number four starter he's done a beautiful job of keeping guys uh keeping this team in games and uh the Phillies have won a lot of his ball games and it's uh a testament as it ends up being a great signing as far as I'm concerned because this guy he knows how to pitch he knows what he's doing on the mound and he's figuring out ways to get people out even without his best stuff I mean look at this offense tonight 10 walks only able to push four across home plate but 10 walks I do like the fact that they're staying within this Strike Zone a little bit more as they did tonight but they got to find ways to get better Runners and scoring position it sounds like a broken record just two for 12 tonight but are you more concerned with that or is the fact that you just got a w I think the W is the most important thing but you would like to see them have the same sort of approach when there's nobody on than when they and as when they have uh runners in scoring position it almost looks like they're trying to do too much to create runs and uh and instead of just kind of letting the game come to them um and so they're not barreling the balls up the guys that are bearing the balls up are Stott and boom uh they're doing it a lot more consistently than even the the other veterans are doing and and to me it's just I think they're just trying to press too much I mean sometimes you felt it you've been there Ben where you're just trying to do a little bit too much and if they have the same sort of approach with nobody on nobody out um as they do with Runners and scoring position I think that they would fare much better I know managers especially in the modern day baseball do not like to give up outs but we saw what Jay cave did today it translated into a two-run double by Johann Rojas I love the fact that they're able to do that especially bottom of the lineup hey try and make something happen at work tonight thanks oh I did it against the left-hander that's pretty pretty tough on lefties and and uh Jake had not been swinging the bat all that well up to that point I'm not sure if he did that on his own or whether it came from The Dugout from Rob Thompson but uh but it ended up working out very well he actually executed quite well it was one of those sort of in-between bunts where you know if he gets it down he'll move the runners but with the possibility of trying to get a base hit as well um and it's not a bad idea and it was huge for Johann Rojas to come up with that big base hit down the left field line in that situation and uh it's nice to see the youngsters uh stepping up and doing some things it's time at some point for the veteran guys to start doing it as well Reuben uh you asked Alec bomb you and Tommy asked Alec bomb about Rob Thompson quote unquote speaking to the team after the game yesterday in which they lost that series to Pittsburgh and I'm wondering if you know what the tone and tenor of that conversation was between manager and team and whether or not I'm sure you've been participating one of those throughout your career what is it like and how does it spur guys on to win games I I think it's an important piece of it everybody thinks that Rob Thompson's like this like chill guy and he is but when he sees things that need to be addressed and he sees them playing the brand of baseball that they played in Pittsburgh which was not very good I mean Alec bone said it himself it was one of the best answers I've seen yeah we've seen in an interview where he said well we've earned it they've earned the fact that they uh they needed a little tongue lashing and I think that uh I I think more than anything else Rob Thomas just pointed out hey this is a better team we're a better team than this we do not play this way this is not our brand of baseball we need to pick it up a notch and uh and and um and I think that that that resonates now when you start doing those having those meetings over and over and over again it becomes White Noise for the players but uh but it was pretty clear that it was something that was needed and then I think it kicked him in the butt a little bit you ever speak to the guys like that as a GM uh I I really don't I I like to leave that up to the the manager that's his job to do that there's from time to time I would have a little chat with certain players individually but um that that really was not my job as a GM um I I felt like that the reason why that I hired that person to be to be the general in the field is to be the General on the field absolutely not like you are here when you bring everybody in say take it in that's right that's right we're going to do a good show tonight all right I hear you all right let me type stuff Emmy type stuff man and you're gonna get it all right buddy thanks so much Reuben tomorrow Junior joining us from Miami we'll check you tomorrow let's take a look at the Wild Card Standings which are going to be wild for the next 56 games or if so there are the Phillies back in the second spot with the Brewers going down they are what one game back of the Giants and the Phil's now at 57 and 49 with Milwaukee Marlins were in there go going into tonight's game now they're not just driving me crazy Ben should I just expect it the rest of the way it's like a tennis match a lot of back and forth and I think you should expect it the rest of the way these teams are showing no signs of of losing ball games or losing Series so the Phillies have to keep up they have to keep Pace they did that tonight that's the bottom line they get three more in Florida and Miami if they can really if they could take three out of four from the fish I think that would just do them wonders and and get them moving more so in the right direction they are now three wins four losses this season against Miami and what's more I talked in the pregame program about Monday being the Phillies worst day of the week and indeed it is they were two and six on Mondays coming into tonight that's not nothing I mean it's not like Sunday when they got an overwhelming winning record but now they're they're three and six and they actually against a team like Miami looked pretty good for for whatever reason the Marlins have their number or have had it now you did some deep I don't know if I did it or the Phillies staff who makes up the notes did it but Mondays are two and six they are 11 and 8 on Saturdays that's their that's their most wins what Saturday maybe it's just you know it's a little hiccup on Mondays they you know they don't play obviously that was just their ninth game tonight on a Monday but they got the job done uh it wasn't it wasn't the prettiest game it wasn't the most energetic game uplifting game but again they got the W and that's the bottom line and I I do think this is a game where they didn't swing the bats great Tyrone Walker didn't have his best stuff but we saw guys like Matt Strom stepped up today uh you know these guys Jeff Hoffman stepped up today Kimber looked great so this is a good team win did anybody do anything that was noticeably great Alec bomb swung the bat well but other than that it was kind of a dull game but they found a way to keep their heads above water and move on accordingly and again they got that w and that's all that matters all right I am interested to hear Rob Thompson's thoughts on this win and perhaps he's asked about what he said to his troops as they went into tonight's game at Miami here's Rob Thompson post game would you think of a walker bouncing back after the first thing yeah it's great I mean velocity was down tonight it just wasn't coming out but um it actually got better as the game went on but um yeah two nothing after the first two hitters and then shuts them right down I think he leaned on his split and his cutter more than those two seams so he just made an adjustment and got it done what's what's going through your mind those after those first two batteries like his fastball is like barely hitting 90 or yeah is there concerning the Dugout yeah there is there is for me I'm wondering if you know there's something going on he said he felt fine it just wasn't it was one of those days just wasn't going coming out so he made the adjustment and I mean pitch great and you know pitchers velocities will fluctuate but I don't think I've ever seen a guy who from one start he could be going 94 and a half yeah and the next starts 91. have you ever seen a pitcher that just for whatever reason when he's healthy just has such ups and downs so and then even tonight you know you went from 90 to 93-94 by the end of it so you found something yeah tonight it's great yeah that's what he does he uses the field you know he gets hits with Runners and scoring position which you know we've struggled with so far this year and that's the one guy that comes through him and stop you can see more time in that spot I think so yeah after kind of a bitter taste in your mouth over the weekend like how like how badly you do you feel like your guys need a game like here tonight yeah I thought it was good I thought we really played well and you know after the first two hitters didn't look too good but uh our guys kept after it and you know like 10 walks again tonight I think that's 31 walks in the last four games so that's I mean some discipline in there but you know we gotta take advantage of that too right so you're not scoring maybe as many runs as you would think with all those walks but does the does the approve decision making at the plate encourage you yes because I always say if as long as you've got base runners you're going to score at some point now you go through times when you know you know hit with Runners and scoring position but just keep putting base runners on you're gonna score and in Rojas another huge hit and then also drew a walking scorer run yeah he's again he's not playing he's never been a part-time player right now so how impressed are you that he's been able to take advantage of his opportunities really impressed and impressed with our hitting coaches too because they keep them sharp and keep them ready ready to go but again you know Jake cave you know bunts for a base hit and kind of gives himself up to that wasn't anything I called and uh yeah you got to play on selfish baseball so you did not yeah you didn't call for the soccer no he did on his own he saw he saw an opportunity to Bunk for base hit well not necessarily well Dominguez was down Marte was basically down I mean I I could have used Marte in an Extra Inning game like the last guy out of the tent um really wanted to stay away from Soto really wanted to stay away from yeah he's probably the guy that really wanted to stay away from him JT screwed up his hand there is he all right yeah he's I think he's going to be fine I don't know how sore it's going to be tomorrow but when he wakes up but um yeah that was kind of strange obviously stuff Can Happen by tomorrow but with Rojas and how smooth he is in center and what it does for your Outfield defense when he is sitting like this I mean does it do you want to put him in more because of that actually Morgan's right-handers or yeah I think we have a little bit you know um but still picking your Spots I'm not sure if Samuel contras you know a guy that we want to put him on but know but I have a lot of confidence in them and you know one thing you're going to get defense

Heat Wave continues as Maricopa County Health Department confirms 39 people have died from the heat in another 312 are under investigation the high temperatures are back this week so please be careful next summer vacation is probably already over now that the kids are back in school but Travel Experts say the end of August is actually one of the cheapest times to travel so if you're looking to book a staycation for the weekend or something more ABC 15's Judy Warren shows us how to best score that deal I've been seeing a lot of this online the question is it cheaper to stay in a hotel or an Airbnb personally I have found airbnbs tend to have better reviews with the Better Price but it really depends in fact when doing a price comparison Sally French with nerd wallet says that the average cost of a hotel room per night is actually cheaper at around 200 compared to a one-night stay at an Airbnb which is around 300 but the longer someone books with a host the cheaper the nightly rate dropping to about 215 a night for a seven night stay the price also changes when you add more people and you also need to consider what's being offered amenities and Resort fees can change the overall cost for a hotel and cleaning fees can really add up the cost of your Airbnb nerd wallet conducted a pretty extensive pricing Study last year and found that typically airbnbs are in fact cheaper for larger groups Airbnb actually introduced a toggle where you can say display the price including the cleaning fees using that toggle when looking up vacation rentals in Prescott for example I saw a three even four hundred dollar difference for the total price and that was before then compared to after those added fees it's also interesting to see the price difference for the end of August compared to say fall break in October I was able to find multiple airbnbs in Sedona where you get the entire home for about three hundred dollars a night a few months later there are fewer in that price range so you do need to book in advance before they are gone nerd wallet also recommends that if you have a preference use that to your advantage for example if you know that you would rather stay in a hotel get a travel credit card to get some of those extra savings there are also some some cards that do give you money back specifically for staying at Airbnb I'm Jamie Warren abc15 Arizona

vanished the case of Alicia Navarro remains a mystery the teenager left her home in Glendale back in 2019 left a note saying I'm leaving but I'll be back only to resurface last weekend four years later more than 1300 miles away tonight we're learning more about where exactly she's been Fox 10 investigator Justin Lum joins us live after speaking to the private investigator who helped Alicia's mom on that long search almost four years now for her daughter John Christina Alicia Navarro walked right into the Haver Police Department in Montana near the Canadian border I'm told she wanted to be taken off the missing persons list so she could get her ID and other documents miracles do exist and never lose hope and always fight stunned and overwhelmed by news she's waited for since Alicia Navarro ran away from her Glendale home in September of 2019. on Wednesday Jessica Nunez reunited with her now 18 year old daughter over a video call Trent Steele president of anti-predator project has been by Jessica side working to find Alicia how many tips have you received yourself if I went back and looked well over a thousand two thousand maybe and they've come in from all over the country all over the world and we've gotten tips from Europe Mexico Canada from coast to coast Los Angeles to New York Seattle to Miami I mean we've gotten tips all over the world why did Alicia end up in Montana well that's the million dollar question a question yet to be answered Glendale Police say the teen walked into Havre Police Department located in a small town in Montana near the U US Canadian border identifying herself and asking to be removed from the missing persons list Steele tells me Alicia wanted to get her ID and other documents but what she's been doing since September 15 2019 is still unclear there's still a lot of moving Parts a lot of moving pieces and I think information is probably going to continue to come out for the next weeks months maybe even years Alicia's mother has told Fox 10 in previous reports that her daughter enjoyed online gaming and could have been lured away from home there was a certain point to where she maybe didn't expect this to have this type of outcome so she's pretty overwhelmed she's trying to deal with the situation and you know obviously she still has other kids at home she still has a life to live so she's trying to get this all in perspective and and pull everything together a statement from Alicia's family to Fox 10 reads in part we want to start by saying how happy we are that Alicia has been found alive and safe it is a blessing that after being missing for so long Alicia can come back home our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families of missing loved ones that have not yet returned home if there is anything that Alicia's story has taught us is that you can never give up hope and Haver PD released a statement to the Press today basically saying they will be assisting Glendale Police with this case whatever they need again though the details are just slowly coming out yeah and you spoke with Alicia's Mom right so what is she feeling right now because this is four years has gone by that's a long time she lost her childhood she feels shocked she's overwhelmed obviously not ready to go on camera at this time but when she called me on the phone she was definitely emotional in tears and just saying a lot is going on right now but she really was more appreciative of the community and everyone on social media through these past three to four years sharing this story again she hasn't physically met with Alicia yet Alicia now 18 we had to see when that type of reunion happens I mean only 14 when she disappears it's hard to imagine she had the wherewithal to care for herself somebody had to be taking care of her so that is what is the next step in this case between Glendale PD and however Haver PD will assist is piecing together the timeline the last three to four years from September 2019 up until now and how long has she actually been in Montana where has she been and what has her life been like there's definitely going to be a lot to navigate here she's an adult now does it complicate it that at 18 does she not have to volunteer any information that's a question that uh we keep asking is what what happens next as far as her adult life clearly she wanted to get things together and get her documents hence being taken off the missing persons list what what triggered that first a lot of questions she might not even come back here right because her mom no longer lives here her mom does not live in Arizona right now we're told and so really this is going to be interesting to see what what's next for Alicia Navarro but I know that obviously the family is just very relieved yeah of course you don't often get this outcome with a case like this so yeah thank you Justin thank you all new at five a story you will only see here on FOX 10 Phoenix police are investigating after a mother says her son who was quadriplegic was dumped out of a wheelchair and onto the hot ground outside of a major Valley Hospital his family says claims the Hospital didn't fully falid him and left him in a park where he was bitten by hundreds of ants unable to move Fox 10 Stephanie Bennett joins us live with the story Steph John and Christina good evening yeah to make matters worse it was also during this brutal summer heat it actually happened right here behind me you can see the hospital on one side and then it's the park right across here where we're at right now now according to police paperwork there was actually a man who lives in this park he is homeless and he claims that he witnessed the whole thing and he actually let the victim use his own phone to call his mom for help now a quick warning to viewers some of this footage may be disturbing see this is my son why did they throw you here Jess this little one is I'll call you anyone and so I'm supposed to pick you up here this is how they discharged my son from the hospital family call him their gentle giant CeCe Garcia holding back tears after she found her quadriplegic son 33 year old Jesus Gomez laying half naked on the ground outside Valley Wise House Maryvale campus so when I got to the park I just turned on my phone and started recording on June 14th paramedics with the Phoenix fire department took Jesus to Valley wise after he says he was having issues with his catheter CeCe works as a caregiver to her son and to others so she was not able to go with him in the ambulance they looked at me they wrote down my name they wrote down all my information they gave me a shot and then they said all right come on let's go let's get out of here hey says as he was waiting three security guards came up asking for his name phone number and address Jesus says he was in a lot of pain and felt dizzy he also suffers from a brain injury and was unable to remember that information that's when Jesus claims the three security guards started pushing his wheelchair out of the hospital he pushed me all the way across the street on the wheelchair threw me off the wheelchair on on the floor at the park they walked away they have that information when the paramedic said they said we left everything they should have all the information they're supposed to call somebody else to put him on a gurney and take him back home but they didn't do that Ceci call 9-1-1 and the same paramedics picked him up and took him to a different hospital I'm sorry that happened to you man because I was the guy that was talking to you earlier according to police paperwork obtained by Fox 10 when officers and the fire captain questioned hospital staff they claimed quote Jesus refused treatment got into a non-motorized wheelchair and left the hospital alone but paper work states that the wheelchair had a safety lever on the back which is only deactivated by the person pushing the wheelchair from behind making the probability of Jesus operating the wheelchair alone highly unlikely let alone the fact that he is a quadriplegic paperwork also shows that the wheelchair was nowhere to be seen indicating that someone brought it back inside I couldn't move I could I couldn't do anything for myself while on the ground Jesus suffered severe swelling and blistering from ants paramedics took him to Saint Joseph's Hospital where he was admitted for six days and underwent surgery for his originating catheter issue in a statement Valley wise tells Fox 10 quote while we cannot discuss individual patient cases due to patient privacy rules Valley wise Health remains committed to providing exceptional care every patient every time in the event an issue arises that's not in line with our mission we take steps to improve outcomes for all patients and modify any policies or procedures to ensure safe and top quality Care he's vulnerable very vulnerable he can't fight back justice will prevail yeah and additionally amongst that police paperwork it says that the fire captain when he went in there and also gave a statement he says quote he responded to several calls for service related to patients of the valley wise hospital being dropped off in this general area where Jesus was located into the past now of course when Phoenix police wrap up their investigation they're going to then pass it along to the State Attorney General's office and they've also notified Adult Protective Services and the Arizona Department of Health as well and the family tells us that they do plan to press charges tonight Glendale Police are searching for the suspect involved in a deadly road rage shooting police say that someone shot and killed a 23-year-old motorcyclist Fox 10's Lauren Clark has more on the investigation well officers say an apparent road rage situation happened a few blocks away and right now they believe that this is related we know a 23 year old lost his life in this quiet area near homes and a school and a Good Samaritan attempted to try to help around 4 pm Austin seidler was driving down 67th Avenue near gelding when he saw the motorcyclist when we pulled up we stopped at the stop sign and before turning I saw the man on his motorcycle still swerving in and out of his Lane seidler recognized something was wrong he fell over and at the time I didn't see what was going on I just saw him fall off of his bike the off-duty MCSO detention officer sprung into action using his first aid training when I ran up I started seeing the blood that was all over him before getting down too close to it what I did is I ran back to my car grabbed my work uniform and a jacket that I had in my car and I put pressure over the wound and then used another piece of clothing to try to put it under his arm to keep him from burning on the uh on the asphalt Austin says he stayed there with the man until paramedics arrived he was unresponsive at the time more just looking around a little bit but that really only lasted a few seconds before he became unresponsive officers with Glendale Police then began a homicide investigation our initial investigation determined that there was some type of road rage incident near 67th Avenue and Greenway with a secondary vehicle one they believe is associated with this shooting but what exactly happened and where the victim was shot is still unknown we didn't hear any gunshot so I'm not sure how far he drove to get to this point and Glendale Police are urging everyone tonight not to engage in Road raid incidents instead just call police they also need your help with this case right now and are trying to find any type of witnesses if you have any information about what happened please reach out to them reporting here in

0ni54o5J,The Phoenix Vibe,The children’s autopsy said they were buried alive,"Convicted Lori Vallow Delivers Spiritual Allocution, Claims Children's Deaths Not Murders",https://newsbreak.com/n/0ni54o5J,RAW: Lori Vallow statement to the court,Lori Vallow gives a statement before an Idaho judge at her sentencing hearing. Vallow was later sentenced to life in prison. For more Local News from KPHO: https://www.azfamily.com/ For more YouTube Content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIrgpHvUm1FMtv-C1xwkJtw,all right Miss fallow before I impose sentence if you choose you may address the court this is known as the right of allocution which permits you to make a statement on your own behalf or present any information and mitigation of the punishment for the crimes you've committed and let me inquire at this time do you wish to address this court all right very well you may make your statement I would like to start by quoting John from the New Testament in the Bible in John chapter 8 verse 7 Jesus says he that is without sin among you let him cast First cast a stone at her then in first verse 15 Jesus says ye judge after the flesh I judge no man and yet if I judge my judgment is true Jesus knows me and Jesus understands me I mourn with all of you who mourn my children and Tammy Jesus Christ knows the truth of what happened here Jesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case accidental deaths happen suicides happen fatal side effects from medications happen I have a different perspective in life because in 2002 when I was pregnant with Tyler I died in the hospital while in labor with her they tried to stop my labor they put me on the table and they put something in my IV and I felt my spirit falling to the floor I was standing near my pregnant body watching the doctors try to revive me which took them a few minutes in that time my sister Stacy was standing to my left I turned to hug her and was surprised that her spirit was as tangible as a physical body because I knew I was in spirit and she was in spirit she said she needed to show me some things and we went to heaven I later returned to my body because of this experience I have access to heaven and the spirit world since then I have had many Communications from people now living in heaven including my children Tyler Ashland and Joshua Jackson my sisters Stacy and Lolly my aunts and my uncles and my grandparents I have had many Communications with Jesus Christ the savior of this world and our Heavenly parents I've had many Angelic visitors have come and communicated with me and even manifested themselves to me because of these communications I know for a fact that my children are happy and busy in the spirit world because of my communications with my friend Tammy dabell I know that she is also very happy and extremely busy I have always mourned the loss of my loved ones and I have lost many in this mortal world however I know that more than most people I know where they are now and what they're doing I know how wonderful Heaven is and I'm homesick for it every single day I know we all lived in heaven before we were born on Earth and we were all adult spirits in the Heavenly realm we chose to come to Earth as Mortals Heaven is more wonderful than you can possibly imagine I do not fear death but I look forward to it I do not I did not want to return to my body when I was out of it even though my son Colby who I adored more than anything was only six years old at the time and I was about to give birth to this new baby girl that I wanted so badly I was a young mother and you would think I wouldn't want to leave my children but as I stood in heaven I did not want to go back I thought they would be fine without me because I was peaceful and I was happy and I was home but then I was told by Jesus that I needed to go back and complete things that I had covenanted or promised to do before I was born this caused me a lot of distress because I knew heaven was my real home and I only wanted to be there I was free from Pain emotional and physical but then I was shown how I would help my children and others in the future so ultimately I did agree to go back to my body Kylie has visited me she is happy and very busy highly is free now from all the Pains of her life Tyler suffered horrible physical pain her whole life I sat with Tyler in the hospital year after year after year while she screamed in pain when the morphine wasn't even enough to take away the pain of her pancreatitis I sat there while she cried and I held back her hair while she threw up and I am the only person on this Earth who knows how much tylie suffered in her life she had pain every single day she never felt good her body did not work right and I don't know if that was from complications from me dying while she was being born or something else but she had a very difficult life she was sexually abused by her own biological father since she was three years old and she was forced by Family Court to go visit him for 10 years against her will I fought for her in court I protected her I tried to protect her with my whole life I tried to protect her I worried about her every single day Tyler had to get her GED because she couldn't go to school every day because she never felt good she felt sick nobody knows this because Tyler like myself tries to put on a good front tries to be a happy person tries to have hope in life tries to know that she's here for a purpose and that she has an eternal purpose to be on this Earth but I never stopped worrying about her one of the times that Tyler came to me as a spirit after she died she said she commanded me and she said to me stop worrying Mom we are fine she knows how I worry and how I miss her the first time JJ visited me after he passed away he put his arm around me and he said to me you didn't do anything wrong Mom I love you and I know you loved me every minute of my life JJ Joshua Jackson was an adult spirit and he was very very tall when he put his arm around me he is busy he is engaged he has jobs that he does there and he is happy where he is his life was short but JJ's life was meaningful JJ was a wonderful person and touched the lives of everyone and I adored him every minute of his life my eternal friend Tammy dabell has visited me on several occasions she came to bring me peace and comfort and I know that she is extremely busy helping her family especially her children and grandchildren and I have a great love for Tammy my beautiful children Tyler Ashland and Joshua Jackson rest safely This Day In the Arms of Jesus my wonderful friend Tammy daybell rests safely this day In the Arms of Jesus and I look forward to the day when we are all reunited and I too will rest with them in the arms of my Jesus all right Miss fella thank you for your comments to the court

For more Local News from KPHO: https://www.azfamily.com/ For more YouTube Content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIrgpHvUm1FMtv-C1xwkJtw",[Music] and welcome back to politics unplugged our panel is here to discuss this week's political headlines that we're joined by Republican consultant Barrett Marson and Democratic political consultant Tony Connie thank you both for being here thanks Dennis one of the big stories of the week that's the esa the empowerment scholarship account program Governors uh hobbs's office put out some new projections this past week saying that it's growing so fast that it's going to end up blowing a hole in the budget agreement they just passed right well even Tom Horton said that has estimated uh approaching one billion dollars for this program and uh you know there are no controls on this program that's for sure uh I I I I do believe that school choice is a very popular thing in Arizona look all the kids that are going to both charter schools and private schools but you know the legislature may have to come back and at least put some curbs on this program to keep it from becoming a the behemoth that it that it may become yeah and that's probably not going to happen until after the next election and only if Democrats are able to get control of the senate in the house something Democrats have failed to do so far yeah but even if they were Democrats were successful and Hobbs Gets A legislature that's her on her side of things don't you think it'd be hard to put some curbs or some curves on this and roll any of this back given that by then this program will have been in effect for a few years I think there's two challenges one is that there is so much money being spent by the anti-public school organization the school choice organization in the state and they're going to spend a ton no matter who the legislature is but I think that people when they see the budget just getting blown up and how expensive this is I do think that people are going to look at well who is it that's getting this the who who's it that's taking this money and that data is going to reveal something that we've known for a long time it's a lot of people who already were in private schools they weren't you know the you know wealthier areas and and then there's some you know stories about the types of things that people are being approved to spend money on and I think that the pressure is going to build and whether or not there's an action that's taken I do think that voters are going to want something about what it means testing kind of thing I mean the legislature Republicans have sold this as opportunity for lower income kids and I I believe that is true but you're going to have to maybe put a you know make that policy we're seeing a lot of growth in people that have already they've been in public private schools they've been an entire lives and now now they're getting this taxpayer money because it's private schools well and you know my my issue is is because there are literally no curbs on this I mean what's to stop a madrasa from coming in right there are no curbs I think you even have like an lgbtq school that is going to open up the legislature probably Republicans probably aren't going to be happy about that and how do you curb that well you can't just say you know no religious schools or you can't just say no muslim schools you know so I think they because they put no restrictions on it they are going to not be happy with some of the outcomes yeah and is the esa program this past week where they take in a bad PR hit because not only did the governor put out her projections again which were in line with when superintendent Tom Horn said um but also we saw the Attorney General Chris Mays come out and say like let me know about any potential Esa scams out there and we had two significant resignations from people who were running that that program and you know and one thing that the Attorney General said is like hey look one of the things that happens here is that public dollars can be going to schools that are allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation or religion or even um don't have the same kind of protections for people with disabilities students with disabilities and one of the challenges here and I think this is the kind of stuff that's going to start popping up is You Know Travis Grantham was the number two guy in the house he tweeted that that is the best reason to get an Esa and so as this information keeps coming out and people start learning more about it I do think that the scrutiny on this office is going to they also think that to your point earlier Dennis these are a lot of people who are already been in uh private schools and they don't have a problem with that right there's right you know they send their kids to a religious school they like that and so I I don't know that that's going to be a big problem for most parents who are in the program right all right I want to move on here before we're getting a little bit short on time here I want to talk a little bit about polling here some polling release by the morning consult showed that uh Governor Katie Hobbs is like the least second least a favorable or a light governor in the country is this something that should be surprising given the fact we came out of a very contentious election it is still a right-leaning State here and she's with Divine with a divided government absolutely Dennis you've kind of answered that question remember a lot of Republicans didn't vote for Katie hubs they voted against Kerry lake so they're not natural constituencies of Katie Hobbs so they probably aren't big fans of a lot of what she's doing but she is in Kerry lake so they didn't vote for her but they are not happy with the direction so I'm not surprised that she doesn't have a big favorability uh uh net gain so far and what can the governor do well I mean the first thing I want to say is that she might be the second least popular Governor compared to all these other states but she's the second most popular elected official in Arizona right I mean she won by point seven percent and she now or 0.8 percent and eight percent more voters approve of the job she's doing than disapprove and so it's sort of an unfair comparison sure she wants it to be higher but the only elected official has a higher approval than her is uh is Mark Kelly you know and you know she's more popular Cinema she's way more popular than Kerry Lake and so I think that she needs to keep doing what she's doing she needs to keep communicating with people because you know that's the way it's gonna get around state will help for sure all right she's getting out of Phoenix getting around the state I hate to cut you off but we do got to wrap it up there and that is all the time we have be sure to join us next week for more politics unplugged good night

and she and she as well as Christina were going on to other things superintendent Tom Horn explaining why the top two administrators of the state school Voucher Program suddenly quit last week the word was they accomplished all they needed to do so why stick around it was the start of a rough week for the empowerment scholarship program less than a year into the largest voucher expansion in the country by the end of the week school voucher supporters were pushing back hard so what's the Fallout joining us to discuss that and much more Christine Jones an attorney and a former Republican candidate for governor and Stacy Pearson a democratic strategist at Lumen strategies welcome back to square off good morning good morning so I want to do a just a quick rundown of that tough week the top two leaders abruptly quit the voucher program days before a new contract is being awarded for managing the program so not sure what happened there Democratic governor Katie Hobbs is warning of a projected 320 million dollar budget deficit next year because of the program's explosive growth in the first year that call Arizona students are eligible and Democratic attorney general Chris Mays put out a consumer alert about the program and asked for evidence of fraud Christine I'll start with you which of these developments should concern the taxpayers who flipped the bill for the half billion dollar voucher program or as voucher supporters say none of them matter well anything that spends money that comes from taxpayers matters especially to Republicans so I do think I'll grudgingly give Chris Mays a little bit of credit to say that the thing we should be focusing on here is fraud I do happen to know having had conversations with people at the Department of Education that they are singularly focused on fraud in that program because it is a very popular program parents are very much enjoying the ability to choose where they send their kids to go to school so I think as we look at spending hundreds of millions of dollars on anything we have to have some Integrity in the process even the people who are adamant supporters of it to say well what are we spending the money on and is it going to actually educate children I'm glad you made that distinction because I hear from parents who use the vouchers and their many are happy with it especially parents of special needs children and parents who homeschool especially those so we get that the issue as you I think correctly pointed out is money and maybe even more management two directors just quit out of the blue well and the Software System the actual system itself designed to distribute this money has no back-end back-end accountability in fact it was leaking data all over the place so folks who have uh children who have IEPs who have disabilities their information is all over the world wide web it's all over the information superhighway and I just can't wrap my brain around how this isn't being addressed is Groundhog Day with the charter experiment from 25 years ago we passed a program that was leading in the nation it blew up in a way that outcomes weren't being watched and being measured kids suffered as a result and we're doing it all over again this time it's just down the street from you and The Homeschool with the five kooky kids yeah and then there is virtually no accountability the home school kids they're not all Cookie they're not all Cookie I'll give you that I'll give you that uh interesting that Katie Hobbs projections are based on the same projections Tom Horn made back in May that Katie Hobbs at the time and the legislature's independent budget committee also said at the time we're a little suspect so my question is where is Katie Hobbs going with this we know she initially wanted to do away with the program is this leading up to something perhaps oh I think they would desperately love to do away with the program and so I'm seeing sort of a lot of Statistics Stacy maybe you are too of people talking about how few people are now going to public schools and it's all blown out of proportion I think Hobbs obviously now has a better Chief of Staff probably more focused on things that matter uh shout out to Chad Campbell who I know we have all have a conflict with here but if she really wants this to go away focusing on what Stacy raised which is are you administering the program appropriately is a much better game play for her than we're spending too much money on it because it is what it is on the money all right onto a subject we can all relate to the historic Heats we've been busy confronting one as existential threat water and kind of ignoring this and wow you know what a month we've been suffering through I've asked both of you to think of effective policy responses to the Relentless warming of our state Stacy I'll ask you to go first look I I applaud the administration for acknowledging we have a problem and I mean this in terms of bite Administration but trees we're going to start with trees a billion dollars in trees I have a lime tree that is stunted I mean it is suffering it needs intervention it needs medical care I mean this is where we're going to start we need to get so far ahead of where this is if we were talking about trees in 1998 great they'd be nice Big Fellas now they'd provide lots of shade but we're so far past trees and better insulation like we've we need to get into this heat island like we've got cool payment on my street and next door blew up because the lady around the corner doesn't like that you see tire marks like lady we're all frying like please stop please stop complaining you're kind of exactly where I'm at how how I mentioned in my interview with Andre uh cherny okay carbon tax do we have to get that aggressive well to Stacy's point point a carbon tax isn't going to solve an issue today in July of 2023. nothing but solventies can we stipulate that nothing will solve an issue and clearly we're all a little [Laughter] being fried but you know I think look if we're going to be compassionate and say what can we do today we have to give people a place to stay that's not in 119 degree weather on a hot piece of concrete my church is doing that I know many churches around the valley are opening up gymnasiums and and sanctuaries and air-conditioned spaces does it make sense to plant trees yes but that's not a today's solution so for policy makers I think they have to say if we're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on vouchers can we spend a few million to keep people from dying in the Heat and I think that is really only and please don't say I'm a bad Republican for saying that I just care about human beings and I think if we really care about people dying in the heat that is the only thing we can do today get them out of it so it sounds like it's a triage situation I see what you did there with the pine tree yeah oh you but seriously this is going to take a much bigger lift to just get us somewhere safe within the next and news flash it's hot in Phoenix in the summer well and you know we've been knowing this but we're also looking at the folks that it in terms of triage pun intended you know we're looking at that but we're also looking at middle class folks that can't afford a 12 000 air conditioner replacement whose houses are now 88 degrees I mean it we're we're squeezing that middle in a way that their foregoing car repairs and they're foregoing um child back to school stuff and groceries I mean that's we're seeing this metal just drop out okay on to the hutzpah award of the week it goes to Kathy Herrod of the anti-abortion center for Arizona policy and the right wing Arizona free enterprise Club they want a judge to give them and only them a free pass to ignore a new state law requiring the disclosure of donors names Herod and the free enterprise Club say their donors are subjected to harassment what should the judge do well we have already a supreme court opinion on this right that says you can't borrow free speech I think Terry goddard's ballot proposition said the voters of Arizona had it had an opinion on this at a minimum from a legal standpoint I don't think we can carve out a particular set of people if you have active threats against your life go to court and get a restraining order limiting speech is not the way to do it from my position as a constitutional conservative what should these Dodgers do oh this is just rich I mean this is just this is insanity I don't like the new rules so I don't want it to apply to me I'm sorry the new law so I don't want it to apply to me is Bonkers like look voters want to know where the money is coming from be it this country be it another foreign adversary be it the guy down the street who's you know a anti-lgbtq um Kook I mean they want to know where who's paying to influence the outcome of Elections I I don't know why this wouldn't apply to her not to mention you're gonna have a lot of people lining up at the courthouse door of the judge allows right that so right we'll see what happens finally one and quickly the do-nothing legislative session uh resumes on Monday after a long layoff a lot of lawmakers have been collecting a nice per diem while they've been off what's going to happen on Monday is this just going to end I think our friend Ken Bennett might come riding into the rescue actually and he's done this before right Ken is a lovely person he's imminently likable and if Peterson and Toma can't get together with Hobbes sorry to throw out the name salad here but I think I'm gonna make a prediction that Ken Bennett comes in and tries to bridge the gap and get a deal done on Prop 400 on Prop 400. state senator Republican state senator Ken Bennett Prescott your prediction well the folks at the table are saying that negotiations continue and that hasn't always been the case and so um as sarcastic as I've been today I do have faith that there are some adults in the room who just want to go home they're just done like just let's let's pick this fight back up uh again in January boy that Heat's getting to you it totally is

Now, the correction department’s own records show for at least one day in July, that was true.",new tonight a bombshell from the 12 News i-team New records that we've obtained this afternoon show just how hot some cells inside of the Perryville women's prison God according to the prison's own logs more than 100 degrees at some points the highest so far 102. the high team's Erica Stapleton has been digging into the extreme heat at that prison and the complaints of old and broken ACS and swamp coolers today she asked the former Warden whether the temperature logs were accurate the inmates got it right more than a dozen complaining to the i-team about cells at Perryville being way too hot some saying more than 100 degrees and now the Department's own records show that's true 100 101 and 102 the three hottest temperatures recorded inside cells at Perryville prison different than what the state corrections director told us last week I have not had a report of any cell hitting the hundreds or feeling like the hundreds the temperature logs just obtained by the 12 News i-team show that cells in the Lumley unit which does not have air conditioning only swamp coolers hit 100 or more on July 17th a drastic increase from any other day recorded before it in July July 17th stands out because that's the same day the i-team first requested any information about the heat at Perryville the records do not include any date beyond the 17th prompting more questions about heat relief in the prison under your watch were the inmates safe from the Heat yes Laura Pyle stepped down from her role as Warden this week after the i-team's reports I don't appreciate that I'm being blasted on the news like this is like this was my fault that the director came and saved Perryville because that's not the case she's talking about the new director Ryan Thornell who sat down with us to talk about the heat before visiting Perryville during this heat wave the temperature checks that you've been receiving how can the public know that they're accurate you know our staff are professionals our staff care about their jobs and our staff care about the the wellness of the population and so to say that what they're doing isn't accurate or not what this it's supposed to be you know that's just not something that I would entertain but multiple inmates and family members told the i-team that the logs might not be right did you ever tell Corrections Officers or staff members to alter the temperature logs that's a negative nobody did do you think it was happening anyway honestly uh I don't think so I mean just like he said I'm gonna say the same I trust my staff inmates also told the i-team that temperatures were sometimes taken at the vent rather than in the rooms to appear lower one of the things that we did find out was that some staff were temping where the air comes out rather than inside the cell which dornell said is not policy our protocol is not to aim it at the the cooling vent or where the cold air is blowing in when we asked Pyle about the triple digit temps she said the women incarcerated at Perryville tell us these issues go beyond July 17th we've been reporting on this for nearly two weeks but only got those temperature logs around 4 30 this afternoon after the Department of Corrections declined our request to interview director Thornell again we've since shared these Logs with Governor Katie hobbs's team Who provided us a statement earlier in the day that did not address the Heat or Perryville but said she's working with Thornell to fix the prisons which means we are still digging into all of this Erica Stapleton

WILL YOUR SUMMER COLD ACTUALLY MIGHT BE A CASE OF COVID SUMMER COLDER CHIEF IMPACT OFFICER SHARP REES-STEALY AND OUR GOOD FRIEND HEADED UP TO ADD THE IS BACK. I GOOD TO SEE OR TALK ABOUT SOME A COLD AND EVERYTHING. BUT THERE'S RISE IN COVID CASES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WHERE SHOULD THE LEVEL OF CONCERN BE RIGHT NOW FOR THAT? SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR COVID HAS ACTUALLY GONE UP. >> IT'S GONE UP BY 12% COUNTRYWIDE. AND SO WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT COVID IS SPREADING. WE'RE NOT USING CASES AS A MEASURE ANYMORE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE TESTING AT HOME. THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU SEE OFFICIALLY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE UNDERCOUNT. BUT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF POSITIVE TESTS HAS ALSO GOT OUT. THAT TELLS US THAT COVID IS SPREADING. AND SO, OF COURSE, THAT'S CONCERNING. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS, PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING HOSPITALIZED, IT'S ABOUT 1000 OVER 1000 COMPARED TO LAST YEAR WHERE IT WAS OVER 40,000. SO IT'S STILL A SMALL NUMBER OVERALL, BUT IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE IT'S GOING BUT USUALLY IS SUMMERTIME IS COMFORTABLE TO HAVE A COLD OR SOMETHING IN IN HEAT AND IT'S NOT THE TIME THAT WE USUALLY CORRELATE WITH CATCHING A COLD. SO IF YOU'RE CATCHING SOMETHING NOW AND THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER, SO IT'S SOMETHING IT'S SPREADING, MAN, RIGHT? IT'S JUST AS EASY. AND IF IT WAS IN THE WINTER, ABSOLUTELY. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE INDOORS MORE. THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST REASON POTENTIALLY WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING. THEY'RE GOING TO ARE BEHIND BECAUSE THERE YOU'RE INDOORS DOING THAT. WE SEE WEEK THERE'S MORE SPREAD ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AND OF COURSE, BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE CONTAGIOUS VARIANTS AND WE SEE INEFFECTIVE WANING IMMUNITY. THE IMMUNITY HAS STARTED TO GO DOWN IN TERMS OF THE PROTECTION BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT VACCINATED AND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN THAT BOOSTER. ONLY 18% HAVE GOTTEN THAT BOOSTER. SO IT WAS ALL THE REASONS THAT COULD BE CONTRIBUTING. YOU HAD SO MANY OF MY TALKING POINTS. ALL OF INFORMATION BECAUSE WANT TO ASK YOU WHY WE'RE SEEING THE RISE IN THE CASES. AND I WANTED TO ASK, I THINK I LOST TRACK AT THE AT THE VARIANCE AFTER IT WAS LIKE BE 2.7. MEAN, AT THAT POINT, I LOST TRACK. >> SO HOW MANY NEW VARIANT WE TALKING ABOUT? AND SPECIFICALLY, WHY IS IT GOING UP? BECAUSE THEY REALLY WENT AWAY COMPLETELY. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S SUCH A GOOD POINT AND NEVER REALLY WENT AWAY. COVID IS STILL HERE COURSE. WE WANT TO FORGET THAT IT'S HERE AND IT'S EASY DO THAT. IT'S STILL HERE. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AS DANGEROUS AS IT WAS BEFORE THE DOMINANT VARIANT WOULD BE THAT XBB OFFSHOOT. SO IT'S REALLY FROM OMICRON. SO OMICRON IS STILL AROUND REALLY VARIANTS OF OMICRON. THAT'S WHAT'S DOMINANT. AND WE SEE THAT EVEN HERE IN SAN DIEGO IN OUR WASTEWATER THAT THAT'S THE DOMINANT VARIANT. >> BUT ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT'S MORE CONTAGIOUS. REALLY? ODDS OF YOU COMING IN CONTACT WITH THIS, IF YOU'RE OUT AND ABOUT PROBABLY 100%, 100%, PROBABLY 100%. IF YOU'RE WALKING OUT AND ABOUT AND YOU'RE GATHERING WITH PEOPLE WHICH WE ALL DO IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES, THEN THE CHANCES OF YOU GETTING EXPOSED TO IT ARE POLLING AT 100%. IT'S BACK AND HE BOUGHT CHANCES OF YOU GETTING ILL AND ENDING UP IN THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE IT WILL DEPEND GREAT. SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IF YOU ARE CLOSER IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HASN'T REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE MAY WITHOUT HAVING SYMPTOMS. AND OF COURSE WE'RE NOT MASKING. SO ALL OF THOSE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING COVID. SO COULD POTENTIALLY, OF COURSE, GET IT. A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, RIGHT, RIGHT AROUND THIS TIME. START BOOKING IT. SO THE FALL, MY KIDS LIKE PHYSICAL SENSE THAT AROUND THE TIME THAT WE THE FLU SHOTS COME UP AND AND ALL THIS AND THE CONVERSATION NOW ABOUT EVEN WITH KIDS AND AND BOOSTERS. >> IT'S 5 GOING TO BE A THING THIS YEAR IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO BE BOOSTED AS WELL. IT SHOULD BE. IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE BECAUSE AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING THE FACT OF WANING IMMUNITY. AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET WORSE IN THE FALL BECAUSE WE WOULD BE FURTHER OUT FROM WHEN MOST PEOPLE GOT THEIR BOOSTER. AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S STILL A RISK IN TERMS OF HOSPITALIZATIONS RIGHT THERE. STILL THAT CHANCE THAT A CHILD CAN END UP IN THE HOSPITAL. AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THE RISKS OF COMPARED WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE, IT'S A NO-BRAINER RATE. GOING TO PROTECT THEM. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT AGAINST ALL THESE VIRUSES THAT COULD BE CIRCULATING. SO I WANT TO ASK YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HONESTLY, I FORGOT I HAD TO OPEN UP MY WALLET ON MY PHONE, A LOOK AT THE VACCINATION CARD. I FORGOT THE LAST TIME. I DON'T KNOW IN MY VACCINATION BOOSTER THING WAS USING ONLY 18% OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOT THE BOOSTER. AND WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT PFIZER AND THEY'RE GETTING THE APPROVAL FOR THE NEW BOOSTER WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT NOW? LIKE NORMAL, OK, FINALLY GOTTEN IT. WE'VE GOT THE BOOSTER BUT HAVEN'T GOT ONE IN ACTUALLY UP SATURDAY. BUT I DON'T KNOW. WHAT NEED TO DO NOW ARE MOVING INTO THE FALL THE WINTER MONTHS. SO IT'S OK, I CAN TOTALLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOPE REALLY MOST PEOPLE SHOULD GO TO THE CDC'S WEBSITE. YOU CAN GO TO CDC'S WEBSITE. YOU CAN GO TO SEND YOUR COUNTY'S WEBSITE. YOU CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE SHOP DOT COM. >> AND IT WILL TELL YOU IF YOU NEED ANOTHER ONE VERY SIMPLE. AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE BIVALENT BOOSTER IS THE MOST RECENT ONE AND EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT. AND THAT ACTUALLY IS REALLY GREAT BECAUSE IT SIMPLIFIED, EVEN IF YOU WOULD NEVER BEEN VACCINATED BEFORE TO GET BIVALENT BOOSTER TO SECOND BASE SITS THIS ESSENTIALLY THE SECOND. BUT WAS THERE A SECOND BOOT ASKED? SO I LOOK AT NOVEMBER 4.21, SO YOU'RE DEFINITELY DUE FOR A THIS IS YEAH, YES, THEY FLU SHOT IS ALREADY A WHOLE PRODUCTION. COULD END BE ABLE TO COMBINE EASE WHEN IT COMES FALL? IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF THEY DO. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THERE THIS YEAR. AND AGAIN, THAT'S PURELY A BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLEX THING TO MANUFACTURER TO PRODUCE AND THEN TO GET AUTHORIZED IN TERMS OF THE COMBINATION.

0nhLLrTc,The San Diego Vibe,stupid.this isn't flyfishing. California libbin.,Flyline Fishing Enthusiasts Overcome Challenges For Successful Catch Aboard 'Legend' Charter,https://newsbreak.com/n/0nhLLrTc,Tuna Mania: Exciting Flyline Fishing Action out of San Diego,We review a recent 2 day trip aboard the Legend. Tune in for some fun flyline fishing!,hey guys welcome back we are going over a recent two day aboard the legend this video right here is from our uh two-day Charter uh private Charter for 976 Tuna we had some really great fishing on Bluefin and a couple of Yellowfin mixed in as well looks like it's this all fly line here for you today um which what were they using for tests uh both days was all fly line fish for the most part uh guys were using like 30 pound tests that seemed to be a good number to get bid on 30 pound test with small hooks like size two or size 4 circle hooks uh definitely smaller Hooks and lighter line it was tough to get a bait to get away from the boat you can see this beautiful beautiful weather that we had during the trip there's not much wind or drift so sometimes when it's like this guys struggle to get their bait away from the boat so what are some things that people can do just cast farther if they can or especially it's important to go out of the corner or what would you say the best tips are um it's just working at it you got to work at it sometimes it'll take 10 baits to get one that's going to swim away from the boat and the guys that are willing to work at it change baits and uh try to find that hot bait that's going to swim away from the boat are the ones that get bit and succeed so that's what it takes sometimes yeah and for a lot of um I think newer fishermen they are a little shy with you know changing out their bait pretty often they like to go a little bit on a longer soak but really I mean that's what bait is there for right it's like go ahead if you don't like the feel of that one it's not so in a way within the first 30 seconds change it out I mean that's again that's why we have these big Vape dinks definitely you'll see if you ever see me fishing you'll see me uh get in the water right away and that bait doesn't move I'm changing out and I have no problem doing that um this trip was a little bit difficult for us the water is starting to warm up very quickly out there we started seeing 71 degree water and this was a weekend trip so a lot of boats were running uh late in July here the San Diego Fleet is pumping and the bait company was having a little bit of a hard time getting enough bait cured out so we did have issues with bait on this trip where there was a lot of red scaly scabbed up bait you know that uh had a hard time swimming so guys really had to work at it to find the right one we even had to go back in and rebate in between days on this trip well it's nice that the fish were close enough to be able to do that right yeah it worked out perfectly for us um the fish were about 40 miles offshore at this point so we were able to uh get back in and rebate and get back out there for the morning bite and it worked out perfect for us we uh we had two really spectacular daytime bites now Bluefin typically like cooler water right uh for the most part you know they uh they aren't tropical like the Yellowfin and Dorado that you would call um which is why on those eight day trips that people go way down there and they're catching those uh 200 pound Yelp and it's in the much warmer water um the water that you see off the coast of Southern California fits the blue fin a lot better than uh those tropical Southern Waters way down there you can see this guy here he because Rod was still pointing down to the fish again make sure that you go into free spool once that fish is gaffed so that way you don't break your Rod yeah for sure you can see right here uh the end of the fight a little bit of a struggle and Matt's trying to direct him to to lay out that fish for him um and like we've touched on other videos that that is key working with your deckhand or whoever has the Gaff next to you to lay out that fish so that you can give them a good opportunity to put a head shot on that fish this guy also is has the bud of the rod and his right armpit um it's not very traditional so we really recommend trying to use that left armpit as at all possible it just gives you a little bit more leverage and a little bit more room to operate with uh the your real hand being a little bit more free yeah if it works it works it's funny we kind of see uh East Coast videos sometimes where they put that uh rod and reel on the right side and here also Southern California everybody puts it on the left side I found it much more comfortable myself for fighting these big fish and of course you see a lot of guys where it just gets tucked into the hip the whole thing yeah but like you said you know whatever's comfortable Whatever Gets the fish up to the boat whatever you fish with confidence that's the most important thing yeah that's all that really matters at the end of the day here is getting that fish up and getting it in the boat it doesn't have to look pretty as long as you get the job done man look at this beautiful fish coming up right now perfect circles this guy's doing a great job of keeping his Rod just straight out and oh there he goes yeah that was our intro clip right there and the fight just wasn't over for him the fish saw the boat and took off um you can see Josh lifting another nice fish up and over the rail here and once again look at this weather it was just absolutely beautiful on this day so these guys were lucky to get incredible weather and really good fishing all on the same trip now with the small Bluefin I guess there's any Bluefin you know is this more of a run and gun trip where you're running to different schools kind of in in a small matter of time or is the school kind of staying with you guys these fish particularly in this day were very very boat friendly and we had long drifts um two to three hour drifts where it wasn't ever wide open it wasn't like we had every single rod on the boat bent but we would keep like four or five fish going at a time at like all times which worked out really well for these guys um it wasn't too much chaos just enough Controlled Chaos where guys were able to communicate moving over and under talking to each other and really minimize the amount of Tangles and we're going to post a fly line setup video here in the next week or so but tell us a little bit give us the overview of the filing setup that they're using yeah so these fish have kind of been transitioning uh we're seeing more of the schooly fish in this warm water so we've had some good fly line fishing like we said 30 pound and small hooks were working really well guys were using fluorocarbon leaders um and for the most part guys we're using like an eight foot stick something rated 20 to 50 pound um like you said we're gonna go over all the details and we're gonna put out a fly line video because fishing is kind of transitioning to that right now so if you guys want to see or pick up any clues on how to get your fly line set up check that one out Legends are made [Music]

0ndR35k0,The San Diego Vibe,Alk a bunch of liars and Thevies. This is a fake show that they care for any or anything.,"SDG&E Bolsters Support for Military Families , Pledges $ 10 Million in Grant Funding",https://newsbreak.com/n/0ndR35k0,SDG&E Supporting Our Military and Community,"Sponsored by SDG&E. San Diego Gas & Electric is committed to improving lives in our community. They have dedicated $10 million dollars to create brighter futures for those who need it most. As part of their shareholder-funded charitable initiative, they have awarded transformational grants to 21 local nonprofits. One of those recipients is STEP, Support The Enlisted Project. The nonprofit works with active duty enlisted service members, military families and veterans who are struggling to make ends meet and helps them get back on track to financial self-sufficiency. STEP CEO and Co-Founder Tony Teravainen joins our Laura Cavanaugh to share how this welcome support will help further their mission. In this current economic climate, inflationary pressures have put more pressure on military families. Many service members and their families face housing and food instability. The need for STEP Emergency Financial Assistance is up 43%. The organization is also stepping up by answering military families’ day-to-day needs with food, diapers and hygiene products. Support The Enlisted Project was awarded a $400,000 grant by SDG&E’s Community Assistance Fund. “This will help us reach more families. Last year we reached 10,000 military families, distributed 400,000 pounds of food, 250,000 diapers,” said Teravainen. “We’re going to be able to increase that by 50% next year. We’re also able to add an additional social worker who can manage an additional 300 cases through our Emergency Financial Assistance Program to help 300 more of these families that are facing imminent loss of basic necessities get through that crisis in a way that makes it their last crisis.” We can continue to support those who have sacrificed so much for our country.

joining us to share how this welcome support will help further their mission is Step CEO and co-founder Tony teravaine and welcome thank you happy to be here now Tony you work with active duty enlisted service members military families and Veterans struggling to make ends meet yeah that's our Focus for the last 11 years we've been working with military families and transitioning veterans here in San Diego and we help them move from a financial crisis where they're losing their house they lose in their car lost their utilities moved from this financial crisis to a lifetime of Financial self-sufficiency and with the 90 success rate and in this current economic climate it's not getting any easier it's not that inflationary pressures the economic situation is putting a lot more pressure on the families they're asking for more help the military leadership is asking for more help and together we're trying to help them not only get through the financial crises but answer those day-to-day needs that they have with food and diapers and other hygiene and Steph was awarded a four hundred thousand dollar Grant from sdg E's community Assistance fund how will this directly impact these service members and families this will help us reach more families last year reached about 10 000 military families distributed three or four hundred thousand pounds of food 250 000 diapers we're going to be able to increase that by about 50 percent next year and then we're also able to add an additional social worker who can manage an additional 300 cases through our emergency financial assistance program to help 300 more of these families that are facing imminent loss of a base necessity get through that crisis in a way that makes it their last crisis and our military families face unique challenges and no two Journal these are the same no no two Journeys are the same and that's really why we rely on one-on-one care each family that comes to us in crisis is gonna get their own social workers their financial counselor and they're going to help them put together a plan that works for their situation military families are in a hard spot most of America doesn't have great financial habits and the first thing somebody does when they join the military is get ripped out of that home environment where their support structure is they get moved around the country every two or three years that puts the spouses in this 50 unemployment underemployment rate that locks the service member into these low-income wages that many of them earn the service member gets deployed between a half and a third of the time and every day when that service member goes to work they're going to the third most deadly occupation in America so we take an average American we put in a situation with higher Financial stress higher family stress and higher work stress and this grant will also help military families step into the holidays and experience a little bit of Joy yeah the holidays are a good time for us we um besides our emergency program we have a lot of Outreach and relationship building programs so they trust us and come to us in their moment of need and in Thanksgiving what we receive from the community is a lot of turkey dinners and related stuff and we can turn around and move that to a lot of military families and the holidays we'll get a lot of folks that want to do toy collections so we can move that to military kids and some families want to adopt an entire family or some members of a family based on their specific requests and we can award about three to four hundred families a year kind of everything they ask for for their holiday season and help them move forward through that time and how how significant is this grant in making a difference this grant will be transformational we have built step as and relied on the community to support us we're not federally funded or state funded we don't have grants or fee for service so it's all Community funded and we work hard for that funding in something like this that is really set up to be transformational is amazing for us it'll help us reach more families and will help us get

it's not related to the unsafe camping ordinance instead the city says they cleared out some encampments because they were creating a hazard for people that were either walking or driving either way the unsafe camping ordinance will go into effect this weekend the city of San Diego said to begin enforcing the unsafe camping ordinance which will ban encampments in certain areas of the city policy director at Alliance San Diego Aaron siromoto grassy says she's seen the city already start to clear out some streets we're seeing a lot of enforcement folks being cleared out of the area leading up to the actual ordinance going into effect I reached out to the city of San Diego and was told the city has cleared some encampments in recent weeks that were blocking roads and creating unsafe driving conditions a city spokesperson says the work has nothing to do with the unsafe camping ordinance and that enforcement of the new ban on encampments will be gradual but suramuda Grassi says the city's approach does not solve the homelessness crisis that's where our folks going to go we know that the city does not have enough shelter for the number of folks that currently need it I trade finding out how much shelter space is currently available but never got a number back from the city one woman who's currently at a shelter tells me she's frustrated with the time it takes to get into housing and move people into a bill herbal spaces I've been in a shelter a year and seven months and have seen very little movement for anybody getting out of there the three percent seem to get help and the rest of us are just lost in the Wayside the city says the ordinance is a tool that allows the city to get people resources and help clear the streets but homeless Advocates say they're concerned the

Transit centers Parks Canyons beaches and homeless shelters regardless of shelter capacity or availability back to you and Russia do we have an answer yet when the city moves people where will the

hydrated and not over exert yourself especially during peak hours chief meteorologist Carlene Chavis is in early tonight with a first look at your micro climate forecast Carlene it is just hot hot out there it is very hot and those peak hours around 11 A.M all the way until 3 because that's when we start to get the most intense sun rays you're also talking about the heating of the day so that's when we get our highs and it's really good idea to not be out there on any hiking trails or any strenuous outdoor activities just something to keep in mind as we continue to deal with the heat we are now in our third week when we take a look at our current temperatures you do have temperatures kind of getting away from the highs that we had earlier today we had some triple digits across Inland areas but still holding on to some 90s we've got 91 degrees for Escondido the same for Poway 93 degrees current temperature for Ramona you also have the 70s along the coast where we had 80s earlier today when it came to those daytime highs we have an excessive heat warning that will continue all the way until Friday night at 8 pm and that is across the desert you're talking 112 to 118 when it comes to those desert highs also with a Inland heat advisory you have that for the Inland areas that's extending in towards Inland valleys in the mountains that's what those 90s and triple digits that pinpoint cities like La Mesa Poway Escondido CNT as well as San Marcos Julian and Pine Valley so we are talking about anything that you see highlighted right there on your screen in Orange we'll go ahead and take a look at your highs and also talk about some monsoonal moisture back in the forecast coming up Carlo thank Carlene it's important to plan ahead if you'll be outside during this excessive Heat Wave hydrate before you leave your house and always bring extra water with you the coast will be the only place to find relief from the heat battalion chief Dave hardenberger says when the Marine layer Burns off it sometimes catches people off guard shade is super important hydration make sure that you're well rested well fed I think a lot of times in the mornings when we have the Marine layer people have a false sense of security it's going to be a nice cool day he also says before walking her pet check to see if the concrete is too hot for them by putting your hand on the ground for at least 10 seconds San Diego is hot right now we've been talking about it all day in the last few days but just how hot is it we think the hottest temperature recorded in San Diego is actually and what's the hottest month we're asking all the questions so we sent CBS Kirsten Holmes to find out okay so it's hot outside but is it really today across San Diego it was only in the 80s but if you were outside you felt hot but what is the hottest San Diego has ever been and when did we get there here's what we found out what's the hottest temperature recorded at the airport I would say 105. I would say at the airport probably about 90 degrees 80s or 90s like maybe like 85 to like 93. hottest temperature recorded at the airport was 111 in 1960 something all good guesses but Julia Andy and Dylan all got it wrong the hottest temperature ever recorded at San Diego International was on September 26 1963 and can you imagine how hot that must have been walking across the tarmac what do you think is the hottest month in San Diego I'm gonna go with July yeah okay July or August both wrong oh I would say August September Roy September I can already smell the pumpkin latte for September that doesn't sound right it's right but we were a little surprised ourselves thankfully I got a friend CBS 8's chief meteorologist Carlene Chavis to help bridge the heat gap for us Carlene it's hot outside but I feel like it's been hotter no it definitely has been hotter this is not even the hottest that we have ever been talking about September 1963 we got to 111. a lot of our hot temperatures actually come around the time of Santa Ana winds so that kind of follows a little bit more into the fall months wacky weather it's definitely warmer than usual but even over the next few months we're still going to be dealing with heat experts like Carlene say what makes it feel so hot is how long the heat wave lasts because the heat is lasting longer than usual and it's hotter than normal Inland and Carlene says brace yourself because next week we're getting ready for more it's still gonna be humid here so everyone's gonna be like oh my gosh it's the hottest no it's not it's just uncomfortable and I'm sorry we've been warned so stay cool and hydrated out there San Diego Kirsten homes cbse stay cool a coalition of Kaiser Permanente unions hit the picket line today with their contracts set to expire on September 30th more than 85 thousand Frontline workers are using this demonstration to bring attention to what they say is understaffing throughout the system employees say low Staffing is making it harder for them to provide quality Care Kaiser says it's a priority to reach an agreement ensuring competitive pay and outstanding benefits for its employees people are finding more and more flyers with hateful messages on them in San Diego neighborhoods specifically targeting Jewish people CBS 8's Ariana Cohen talked with San Diego Police and the leaders of a stop anti-Semitism group San Diego Police collected multiple Flyers off-car windshield today with anti-semitic messages so we're not going to get into what these flyers say we're not going to amplify any kind of message of hate these flyers are they're inflammatory they're racist they're bigoted they're just they're nasty and the police department doesn't stand for we stand with the community against any kind of hate incident police found them on Zion and archwood streets in the Allied Gardens area Lieutenant Adam Sharkey tells me this is not considered a hate crime but merely a hate incident that they will investigate leaving flyers in a public place on a on a vehicle parked in a public place regardless of the content unless it meets very specific thresholds does not qualify as a crime as disgusting and as distasteful as that message might be now if it reaches something where windows are broken or somebody's assaulted or things of that nature that is a crime however Leo Laura res executive director of the non-profit stop anti-Semitism disagrees when we look at the office of civil rights which protects against race ethnicity and religion the Jewish people are infected are in fact a protected Civil Rights group and these particular flyers and this white supremacist group is targeting solely the Jewish people so we disagree with that statement that this is not a hate crime it is in fact one case of physical assault shouldn't have to happen for them to enact hate crime laws this group basically they blame everything from abortion to the gun control debate to covid to the Ukraine war to now animal Slaughter on the Jews and their sole goal is to isolate and vilify the Jewish people San Diego Police are investigating a hate crime involving an assault against a San Diego Chabad Jewish Center member we are investing in investigating a hate crime we are Act actively working leads pertaining to that case earlier this month CBS 8 talked to this couple who found similar flyers in their San Carlos neighborhood people living in del Cerro and Santee say they found flyers on their car windshields too anti-Semitism is getting only worse at a very startling rate in California and we need to do everything possible to put a stop to this Ariana Cohen CBS 8. disturbing stuff thanks Ariana still ahead tonight a plea deal for President Biden's son falls apart in federal court plus the hero who jumped into action when a pregnant postal carrier was overcome by the Heat and up next experts make the connection between our Global Heatwave and human-made climate change foreign

to be mid 90s here at Jenny you know I just read that Phoenix has surpassed 110 degrees for the last 28 days almost a month now I mean it's hot out there really Nationwide we're we're just seeing some impressive heat you know when I last filled in it's kind of funny we were talking about June gloom and now we're talking excessive heat so we're getting a little bit of everything around here I want to start though with how the morning commute is looking we are are seeing a good amount of fog along the coast so this model gives you a look at that really some dense fog to start your day so just keep that in mind as you get outside live look outside from our Mount Soledad camera now that the sun is finally starting to come out the sun is shining and again you can see that that layer of fog along the coast though current temperatures right now are already starting to climb we are at that 70 degree Mark ish for most of the county and again that's only expected to climb brego Springs already at 6 a.m 87 degrees let's take a look at those forecast highs Carlsbad today will get to 81 degrees San Diego overall will be about 82 Miramar Poway the further Inland you are the hotter it is going to be Escondido going to be close to 94 degrees today El Cajon again 95 Del Mar maybe we all head to Del Mar it's going to be 77 degrees there today Chula Vista will get close to that 80 degree Mark we are going to see a relief though excessive heat will remain in effect until 8 pm on Friday and then things are going to really improve and turn around if you like temperatures a little bit cooler so again perfect time to start out your weekend things will definitely start to improve eight day forecast again it's going to be hot out there mountains and deserts you have a better chance for thunderstorms so keep that in mind but that will be hopefully what helps us break the heat as you get outside and are maybe heading to work heading to meet someone for breakfast I hope it's again just a great start to your Wednesday things are really smooth sailing out there on our freeways back to you guys you know what before we before we get to you I do want to tell you about the border

bit of pressure on both sides I imagine it's a bit heightened now but you have the ability for three hours to be able to carb mineralize all of that stuff and forget about those rumors that go out there and play Blake's Nell on the mound for the Padres here tonight in his last 11 a 0.71 era walks were something of an issue last time but at the end of the night against the Blue Jays he allowed one run the old friend Connor Joe is going to lead it off there's a pop-up left side of the infield that has Bogart's back pedaling to the Short Line in Left for out number one Ryan Reynolds who was on for four last night Reynolds was on the IL well the Pirates were sweeping the Padres in Pittsburgh back goes to Tasty leaps and makes the catch up against the Paul holds on to the baseball they

first inning for Blake Snell and he caps it with a K Rich Hill continue to try to keep those blocks down but it's obviously going to be a big key to success here limited to base runners in the free passes it's Kim leading off at second center fielder Reynolds that's a good start right there to keep him off the bases can I have all the left for Joe two down two Fly ball outs 2-2 foul tip struck him out he threw the fastball by him at 88 miles an hour Rich Hill a one two three first there is that first dreaded walk Allowed by Blake's now it comes to lead off the second inning here's Henry Davis lives is toward left center field that's a bullet that's past the left fielder Soto and rebelo will wave home Santana a little hesitation around third and he's gonna be there and it's an RBI double for Henry Davis in a one-nothing pirates lead oh what a nice job Mike robello right there on the scent Manny Machado to lead things off for the Padres they Trail the Pittsburgh Pirates one to nothing I drive deeply it is far it is Manny Manny Machado with his 20th of the Year ties the game with one swing of the bad middle in and we know what Manny can do there he's got that sound to it as well oh yeah Rich Hill will need a new baseball Xander Bogarts a line in the center field a ring single for Bogarts swinging a miss a little hit and run there and taking offense successfully getting to second base is Bogarts real good jump at first for Bogarts one out 1-1 Sanchez at 193 with nine homers is Inlet Center Field yards or the go-ahead Run Padres take a 2-1 lead Gary Sanchez driving it in got the hands in Oh serious topspin also third goes Sanchez Baden the second top of the order coming up second time through now with Kim coming up 2-1 is hit high and deep but playable out toward left Connor Joe is there and he'll take it for the final out Padres get two strand two in scoring position edges 177 with one Homer and 14 runs batted in three in one Hedges hard hit on the ground

against Rich Hill swinging a bench he struck him out third strikeout tonight for Hill one away and campusano takes inside Ball Four first walk of the night Allowed by Rich Hill and that'll bring up Gary Sanchez 1-1 muscled in the air to deep right center field long run for Davis and Reynolds both going back it'll hop over the wall or ground rule doubled in right center field that'll cost the Padres a run as camposano has to stop at third base what a really well hit ball by Gary Sanchez he's two for two with a single and a double one out second and third infield in now [Applause] able to Rob baton and keep this a one-run deficit swinging a ground ball one hop to Santana he's got it and onto the bag for the final out so Rich Hill pitches out of a jam leaves two in scoring positions and all of a sudden after retiring 10 in a row Snell has walked back to back hitters Austin Hedges a little Chopper oh past the pitcher Snell decided to let it go and it's going to be an infield hit for Hedges and now the base is loaded situation for Connor Joe 70th pitch coming up for Snell and a swing and a miss he struck out Connor Joe he went around and Strikes Out Pirates Gonna Leave Him loaded Snell's out of it yet again pitches his way around two walks in the inning and has flied out of Center flight out to left 0-4-2 lined in the left Center a base hit for Kim out of the reach of paguero

he'll go to First and that is that Blake Snell out of another Jam walks two in the inning five and a half done 2-1 San Diego so another walk by Pirates hitters they've drawn six walks today now you see if Andrew McCutchen can pick up his teammate diving to make the catch Juan Soto lays it out and left and the Padres will keep their lead new pitcher Angel Perdomo checks in for the Pirates and wants Soto and over three night for the Padres he says empty for Soto and he drives one to deep right field oh that's not coming back it is seat of San diegans puts the Padres on top three to one big run for the Padres who have taken a two-run lead hit in the back is Machado with a 98 mile an hour fastball now the umpires are getting together here whether or not to hand out warnings Austin ejected they rolled it was on purpose and now he's being tossed he'll leave also the runner on second nobody out another opportunity to add on Gary Sanchez to bat and drives this to left center field but goes Reynolds up the wall gone Gary Sanchez hits his 10th home run it's a two-run shot and it puts the Padres on top five to one that's the second out so the Rancho Bernardo kid at first base with a

I WAS HUNGRY. HEY, LISTEN, WITH US. BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE'RE MOVING BACK INTO A HEATWAVE. DRIER AIR IS MOVING IN. THE HEAT DOME WILL BE BUILDING BACK OVER THE WEEKEND, ESPECIALLY. YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE THAT. AND RECORD TEMPERATURES ARE AHEAD AS WELL. SO LET'S LOOK AT THIS DRY STRETCH. THE DRY STRETCH WE EVER HAD WAS LIKE 121 YEARS AGO, 109 DAYSYS N A ROW WITHOUT ANY MEASURABLE RAIN. NOW, THE FIFTH DRIEST STRETCH IN RECENT MEMORY, IT WOULD BE 2018. THAT'S 96 DAYS. THE 12TH DRY STRETCH WOULD BE 78 AND 2022. WE'RE AT 73 RIGHT NOW. BUT AS THE SUMMER PROGRESSES, WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE GOING TO BE ADDING TO THAT HEAT ADVISORIES AND EXCESSIVE HEAT. WATCH IN PLACE THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO. IT KICKS IN TOMORROW. MANY AREAS. IT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND BECAUSE THE HEAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD HIGH PRESSURE IS TO THE EAST OF US. EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO BACK ON US AND KEEP THE HEAT RAGING OVER SOUTHWESTERN PARTS OF THE E STA. YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF MOISTURE WORKING ON IT INTO SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE STATE, BUT NOT MUCH IN THE NORTHWEST. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE DRIER AIR, THIS AREA IN THE ORANGE IS WORKING INTO THE MID LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. SO IT'S KIND OF PUTTING A SQUASH ON THE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE AREA. AND THIS WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE OVER IN THE DAYS AHEAD. FRIDAY, 68 DEGREES AROUND 7:00 IN THE MORNING. AND THEN LOOK AT THAT, THE NORMAL HIGH FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR 90. WE'RE GOING TO BE UP NEAR RECORD TERRITORY AT 98 DEGREES. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT, SOME SPOTTY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AND THE MORE HUMID AIR OVER SOUTHEASTERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO. BUT PRETTY DOGGOGONE DRY EVERYWHERE ELSE AND PRETTY HOT AS WELL. AND AGAIN, THOSE HEAT ADVISORIES TO THE SOUTH, I THINK THEY'LL BE EXPANDING GOING INTO FRIDAY AND INTO SATURDAY. I THINK HEAT ADVISORIES WILL BE SPREADING NORTHWARD ON INTO THE ALBUQUERQUE AREA FOR THE START OF YOUR WEEKEND AND MUCH THE SAME GOING INTO SUNDAY. AND REALLY NOT A WHOLE LOT OF CHANGE AS WE GET DEEPER INTO THE UPCOMING WEEK.
